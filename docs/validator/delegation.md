## Overview

If you don't want to run a validator node by yourself, NEAR Protocol supports the delegation of your stake using smart contracts. 
These contracts can be used via RPC, command-line interface (CLI) or graphic user interface (GUI) by leveraging the same `view` and `call` methods.

## GUI-based delegation
Disclaimer: the list below is community-maintained, and is not an endorsement by NEAR to use any of them. Do your own research before staking your funds with them!

## CLI-based delegation
Disclaimer: the documentation below refers to the Github repository [Core Contracts](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/). Always check the source of the smart contract before delegating your funds to it!

NEAR Core Contracts support two types of delegation:

1. Lockup Contract 
2. Staking Pool

Before starting, make sure you are running the latest version of [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli), and you are familiar with [gas fees](../concepts/gas).

### 1. Lockup Contract

The [Lockup Contract](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/master/lockup) is common among NEAR contributors and, essentially, anyone who didn't acquire tokens through an exchange. This contract acts as an escrow that locks and holds an owner's tokens for a lockup period (such as vesting).
The owner may want to stake these tokens (including locked ones) to help secure the network and also earn staking rewards that are distributed to the validator. The lockup contract doesn't allow to directly stake from its account, so the owner delegates the tokens using the contract built-in functions.

<blockquote class="warning">
    <strong>heads up</strong><br><br>
    The commands below are tested with <a href="https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/877e2db699a02b81fc46f5034642a2ebd06d9f19">build 877e2db</a> of the Core Contracts.
</blockquote>

Before proceeding with the tutorial below, check that you have control of your lockup contract, by issuing the command
```
near view <LOCKUP_ID> get_owner_account_id ''
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view meerkat.stakewars.testnet get_owner_account_id ''
View call: meerkat.stakewars.testnet.get_owner_account_id()
'meerkat.testnet'

```
Where the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`; and the result is `meerkat.testnet`. In the following examples, `<OWNER_ID>` is always the output of this command.


You can stake with Lockup contracts in three steps:
1. Set up the staking pool
2. Deposit and stake the tokens
3. Measure the rewards

#### 1. Set the staking pool
Lockup contracts can stake **to one staking pool at a time**, so this parameter can be changed only while no funds are staked.

You can select the staking pool by calling the method `select_staking_pool` from the lockup contract:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> select_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_account_id": "<POOL_ID>"}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet select_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_account_id": "zpool.pool.f863973.m0"}' --accountId meerkat.testnet

Scheduling a call: meerkat.stakewars.testnet.select_staking_pool({"staking_pool_account_id": "zpool.pool.f863973.m0"})

```
Where the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`; `<POOL_ID>` is `zpool.pool.f863973.m0`; and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`.
The `true` statement means that your call was successful, and the lockup contract accepted the `<POOL_ID>` parameter.

#### 2. Deposit and stake the tokens
Lockup contracts can stake their balance, regardless of their vesting schedule. You can proceed in two steps:
1. check the lockup balance
2. stake the balance

1. To know how many tokens you can stake, use the view method `get_balance`:
```
near view <LOCKUP_ID> get_balance ''
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view meerkat.stakewars.testnet get_balance ''
View call: meerkat.stakewars.testnet.get_balance()
'100000499656128234500000000'
```
Where the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet` and the resulting balance (in Yocto) is `100000499656128234500000000` or 100 $near.

<blockquote class="warning">
    <strong>heads up</strong><br><br>
    You have to leave 35 $near in the lockup contract for the storage fees. If you have 100 tokens, you can stake up to 65 tokens.
</blockquote>


2. To stake the balance, use the call method `deposit_and_stake`:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> deposit_and_stake '{"amount": "<AMOUNT>"}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expext a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet deposit_and_stake '{"amount": "65000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId meerkat.testnet --gas 200000000000000

Where `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`; `<AMOUNT>` is `65000000000000000000000000` (the total available, minus 35 $near for the minimum balance); and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`.
The `true` statement at the end means the transaction was successful.

<blockquote class="warning">
    <strong>heads up</strong><br><br>
    The example above set the pre-paid gas to 200000000000000 Yocto, as near-cli default allocation was too low.
</blockquote>


#### 3. Measure the rewards
NEAR Protocol automatically re-stakes your rewards. You need to manually check the balance of the staking pool to know their total amount.

Use the use the call method `refresh_staking_pool_balance` to check your new balance:
```
near call <LOCK_ID> refresh_staking_pool_balance '' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet refresh_staking_pool_balance '' --accountId meerkat.testnet | grep "current total balance"
	Log [meerkat.stakewars.testnet]: The current total balance on the staking pool is 65000000000000000000000000
```
Where `<LOCK_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`, and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`. In the example above, the result is passed to `| grep "current total balance"` to display only the relevant output.

Please refer to the [Lockup Contract readme](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/master/lockup) if you need to know how to withdraw the staking rewards to your main wallet.



### 2. Staking Pool
Any other funds can be directly delegated to a [staking pool](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/master/staking-pool) by using the call method `deposit_and_stake`:
```
near call <POOL_ID> deposit_and_stake '' --accountId <OWNER_ID> --amount 100
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0 deposit_and_stake '' --accountId meerkat.testnet --amount 100
Scheduling a call: valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0.deposit_and_stake() with attached 100 NEAR

Where `<POOL_ID>` is `valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0`; and the `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`.


If you want to check your staking rewards, use the view method `get_account`:
```
near view <POOL_ID> get_account '{"account_id": "<OWNER_ID>"}'
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0 get_account '{"account_id": "meerkat.testnet"}'
View call: valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0.get_account({"account_id": "meerkat.testnet"})
{
  account_id: 'meerkat.testnet',
  unstaked_balance: '1',
  staked_balance: '100663740438210643632989745',
  can_withdraw: true
}
```
Where `<POOL_ID>` is `valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0` and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`. The staked balance is `100663740438210643632989745`, or `100.66` tokens.

Use the call method `ping` to re-calculate your rewards up to the previous epoch:
```
near call <POOL_ID> ping '{}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0 ping '{}' --accountId meerkat.testnet
Scheduling a call: valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0.ping({})

Where `<POOL_ID>` is `valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0`; and the `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`. The `''` result means that your call was successful, and the `get_account` view method will provide updated results.
