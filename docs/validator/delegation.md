## Overview

To learn more about what validation and delegation are, please see the [Validation docs](https://docs.near.org/docs/validator/staking-overview) and [validation FAQ](https://docs.near.org/docs/validator/staking-faq). The current page will describe the mechanics of participating in delegation.

At a high level, anyone can delegate their tokens to a staking pool which is run by a validator. This is possible even if your tokens are in a lockup contract (as most tokens are during the network's early release). Delegating to a staking pool allows you to receive some staking rewards (which will activate as part of the Phase II rollout and depend on the exact fees charged by the validator) and to participate in protocol governance by adding weight to the vote of the validator whose pool you have delegated to. 

You can participate in delegation by using a website (GUI), using the `view` and `call` methods of the command-line interface (CLI) or via sending RPC calls directly. 

You can find a real-time list of validators on [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/nodes/validators).

If you haven't already, evaluate your token custody option from [this documentation page](../tokens/token-custody).

## GUI-based delegation (via a website)

Disclaimer: the list below is community-maintained, and is not an endorsement by NEAR to use any of them. Do your own research before staking your funds with them!

## CLI-based delegation

Disclaimer: the documentation below refers to the Github repository [Core Contracts](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/). Always check the source of the smart contract before delegating your funds to it!

You can use `near-cli` with NEAR Core Contracts to delegation via:

1. Lockup Contract 
2. Staking Pool

Before starting, make sure you are running the latest version of [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli), and you are familiar with [gas fees](../concepts/gas).

## 1. Lockup Contracts Delegation

The [Lockup Contract](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/master/lockup) is common among NEAR contributors and, essentially, anyone who didn't acquire tokens through an exchange. This contract acts as an escrow that locks and holds an owner's tokens for a lockup period (such as vesting). You can learn more about lockups and their implementation in the [this documentation page](../tokens/lockup).

The owner may want to stake these tokens (including locked ones) to help secure the network and also earn staking rewards that are distributed to the validator. The lockup contract doesn't allow to directly stake from its account, so the owner delegates the tokens using the contract built-in functions.

<blockquote class="warning">
    <strong>heads up</strong><br><br>
    The commands below are tested with <a href="https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/877e2db699a02b81fc46f5034642a2ebd06d9f19">build 877e2db</a> of the Core Contracts.
</blockquote>

Before proceeding with the tutorial below, check that you have control of your lockup contract, by issuing the command
```
near view <LOCKUP_ID> get_owner_account_id ''
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view meerkat.stakewars.testnet get_owner_account_id ''
View call: meerkat.stakewars.testnet.get_owner_account_id()
'meerkat.testnet'

```
Where the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`; and the result is `meerkat.testnet`. In the following examples, `<OWNER_ID>` is always the output of this command.


You can stake with Lockup contracts in three steps:
1. Set up the staking pool
2. Deposit and stake the tokens
3. Measure the rewards

### a. Set the staking pool
Lockup contracts can stake **to one staking pool at a time**, so this parameter can be changed only while no funds are staked.

You can select the staking pool by calling the method `select_staking_pool` from the lockup contract:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> select_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_account_id": "<POOL_ID>"}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet select_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_account_id": "zpool.pool.f863973.m0"}' --accountId meerkat.testnet

Scheduling a call: meerkat.stakewars.testnet.select_staking_pool({"staking_pool_account_id": "zpool.pool.f863973.m0"})

```
Where the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`; `<POOL_ID>` is `zpool.pool.f863973.m0`; and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`.
The `true` statement means that your call was successful, and the lockup contract accepted the `<POOL_ID>` parameter.

### b. Deposit and stake the tokens
Lockup contracts can stake their balance, regardless of their vesting schedule. You can proceed in two steps:
1. check the lockup balance
2. stake the balance

1. To know how many tokens you can stake, use the view method `get_balance`:
```
near view <LOCKUP_ID> get_balance ''
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view meerkat.stakewars.testnet get_balance ''
View call: meerkat.stakewars.testnet.get_balance()
'100000499656128234500000000'
```
Where the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet` and the resulting balance (in Yocto) is `100000499656128234500000000` or 100 $near.

<blockquote class="warning">
    <strong>heads up</strong><br><br>
    You have to leave 35 $near in the lockup contract for the storage fees. If you have 100 tokens, you can stake up to 65 tokens. If you have 1000 tokens, you can stake up to 965 tokens.
</blockquote>


2. To stake the balance, use the call method `deposit_and_stake`:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> deposit_and_stake '{"amount": "<AMOUNT>"}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet deposit_and_stake '{"amount": "65000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId meerkat.testnet --gas 200000000000000

</blockquote>


### c. Measure the rewards
Since NEAR automatically re-stakes every staking pool rewards, you have to update your staked balance to know the amount of tokens you earned with your validator.

Use the use the call method `refresh_staking_pool_balance` to check your new balance:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> refresh_staking_pool_balance '' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet refresh_staking_pool_balance '' --accountId meerkat.testnet | grep "current total balance"
	Log [meerkat.stakewars.testnet]: The current total balance on the staking pool is 65000000000000000000000000
```
Where `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`, and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`. In the example above, the result is passed to `| grep "current total balance"` to display only the relevant output.

Please refer to the [Lockup Contract readme](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/master/lockup) if you need to know how to withdraw the staking rewards to your main wallet.

## Unstake and withdraw your lockup tokens
NEAR Protocol automatically re-stakes all the rewards back to the staking pools, so your staked balance increases over time, accruing rewards.

Before starting, it's highly recommended to read the [Lockup contracts documentation](../tokens/lockup) to understand which portion of the tokens is liquid, and which one is still _locked_ even after the three epochs.

If you want to withdraw funds, you have to issue two separate commands:
1. Manually unstake tokens from the staking pool, and wait three epochs
3. Manually withdraw tokens back to your main account

Both these command require the amount in _yoctoNEAR_, which is the smallest unit of account for NEAR tokens. You can use the table below for the conversion:

| NEAR |  YoctoNEAR  | YoctoNEAR |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------|
| `1` | `1*10^24` | `1000000000000000000000000` |
| `10` | `1*10^25` | `10000000000000000000000000` |
| `100` | `1*10^26` | `100000000000000000000000000` |
| `1,000` | `1*10^27` | `1000000000000000000000000000` |
| `10,000` | `1*10^28` | `10000000000000000000000000000` |

As an example, if you want to unstake `10` NEAR tokens from the staking pool, you have to call the method `unstake` with `10000000000000000000000000` (`1*10^24`, 10 power 24, or 10 with 24 zeros) as an argument.


### a. Unstake the tokens

Before unstaking any tokens, use the the view method `get_account` introduced above to know what is the available balance:
```
near view <POOL_ID> get_account '{"account_id": "<LOCKUP_ID>"}'
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view zpool.pool.f863973.m0 get_account '{"account_id": "meerkat.stakewars.testnet"}'
View call: zpool.pool.f863973.m0.get_account({"account_id": "meerkat.stakewars.testnet"})
{
  account_id: 'meerkat.stakewars.testnet',
  unstaked_balance: '5',
  staked_balance: '86236099167204810592552675',
  can_withdraw: false
}
```
Where `<POOL_ID>` is `zpool.pool.f863973.m0`, and the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet`. The result of this method shows:
* An unstaked balance of `5` _yocto_
* A staked balance of `86236099167204810592552675` _yocto_, or `86.23` NEAR tokens
* `can_withdraw` is `false` (see below)

<blockquote class="info">
    <strong>Check your rewards</strong><br><br>
    From the examples above, the initial stake of 65 NEAR tokens increased to 86.23 tokens, with 21.23 tokens as a reward!
</blockquote>

You can unstake an amount of funds that is equal or lower than your `staked_balance`, by calling the metod `unstake`:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> unstake '{"amount": "<YOCTO>"}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call meerkat.stakewars.testnet unstake '{"amount": "42000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId meerkat.testnet --useLedgerKey="44'/397'/0'/0'/1'" --gas 300000000000000

**Wait three epochs, or \~36 hours before using the withdraw command**

For security reasons, NEAR Protocol keeps your unstaked funds locked for three more epochs (\~36 hours). Use again the view method `get_account` to verify if `can_withdraw` is `true`:
```
near view <POOL_ID> get_account '{"account_id": "<LOCKUP_ID>"}'
```
The result should be as follows:
```
$ near view zpool.pool.f863973.m0 get_account '{"account_id": "meerkat.stakewars.testnet"}'
View call: zpool.pool.f863973.m0.get_account({"account_id": "meerkat.stakewars.testnet"})

  staked_balance: '44244760537191121230392104',
  can_withdraw: true
}
```
Where `<POOL_ID>` is `zpool.pool.f863973.m0`, the `<LOCKUP_ID>` is `meerkat.stakewars.testnet` and the variable `can_withdraw` is `true`. This means that your `42000000000000000000000000` _Yocto_ (42 NEAR tokens) are now available for withdraw.

### b. Withdraw the tokens
Funds can be withdrawn after three epochs (\~36 hours) from the `unstake` command. It is highly recommended to read the [Lockup contracts documentation](../tokens/lockup) to understand which portion of the unstaked tokens is available for transfers, and which is still vesting and unavailable (even after three epochs).

Use the call method `withdraw_all_from_staking_pool`:
```
near call <LOCKUP_ID> withdraw_all_from_staking_pool '' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like this one:
```

If you want to check your staking rewards, use the view method `get_account`:
```
near view <POOL_ID> get_account '{"account_id": "<OWNER_ID>"}'
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near view valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0 get_account '{"account_id": "meerkat.testnet"}'
View call: valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0.get_account({"account_id": "meerkat.testnet"})
{
  account_id: 'meerkat.testnet',
  unstaked_balance: '1',
  staked_balance: '100663740438210643632989745',
  can_withdraw: true
}
```
Where `<POOL_ID>` is `valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0` and `<OWNER_ID>` is `meerkat.testnet`. The staked balance is `100663740438210643632989745`, or `100.66` tokens.

Use the call method `ping` to re-calculate your rewards up to the previous epoch:
```
near call <POOL_ID> ping '{}' --accountId <OWNER_ID>
```
You should expect a result like:
```
$ near call valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0 ping '{}' --accountId meerkat.testnet
Scheduling a call: valeraverim.pool.f863973.m0.ping({})
