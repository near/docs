Welcome! If you are in this repository, you are probably interested in contributing to NEAR's development; whether through engineering efforts, content creation or event organisation. Maybe you have already an initiative in mind or you want to find ways to get started. In any case, you are in the right place.

This file lists several example contributions that we would love to collaborate on with the community i.e. you!

## Contribution tasks

### Development

Testing

If you are interested in testing our documentation, guides and developer tools, head over to the following pages. We would love to jump on a call and get to know your insights, or you can submit directly issues in the respective repositories on GitHub. For more information on where and how to file issues, please head over to our developer contribution section.

* [Developer tools](/docs/local-setup/create-account)
* [Local development](/docs/local-setup/local-dev-testnet)
* [Introduction to near-api-js](/docs/roles/developer/examples/near-api-js/introduction)
* [Guides](/docs/roles/developer/examples/near-api-js/guides)
* [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/zero-to-hero)

Development
* Our [API documentation](/docs/api/quickstart) needs work; we are looking for developers to dig through the documentation and create examples. Please submit changes to the [docs repository](https://github.com/nearprotocol/docs).
* We are always looking for more example applications. If you are interested in building a dApp, we would love to help you along the way and see the final result. 
* Create a walk-through example of how to use the [NEAR-explorer](/docs/quick-start/near-explorer) or highlight different aspects of the [NEAR-shell](/docs/development/near-shell). An example walkthrough of the wallet can be found [here](/docs/local-setup/create-account). Please submit your example to the [docs repository](https://github.com/nearprotocol/docs).

You can always ask questions on either of our developer channels or on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=nearprotocol).

### Content creation

We receive lots of requests by the community on specific content they would like to see to better understand NEAR. To enhance diversity of thought, we would love to receive external contributions. Example content includes:
* Write a blog post about use cases, open web, and business models on NEAR Protocol. You can also reach out to projects that are currently building on NEAR on [Discord](http://near.chat/).
* Create an info-graphic e.g. explaining transactions; in this case, you could base the info-graphic on the following [video](https://youtu.be/2_Ekz7w6Eo4) and the [documentation](/docs/concepts/account).
* Write a blog post, explaining the Economics on NEAR to a non-technical audience. You can base it on this [paper](https://near.org/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/).
* Look through our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKdIYVN8iE3fv8alyk1aMw) and create a blog post on the same topic as one of the videos.
