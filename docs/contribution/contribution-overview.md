Welcome! If you are in this repository, you are probably interested in contributing to NEAR's development. 

We have tons of open issues across repositories and regularly post [bounties](https://github.com/near/bounties).

To learn more about the contribution flow for developers, please head over to the [Developer Contributions walkthrough](/docs/contribution/technical-contribution).

## Contributor Program

If you like contributing to NEAR and would like to get formally involved with continuous contributions, the [contributor program](https://near.org/contributor/) is the right place for you.

As part of the NEAR contributor program
* You are the first to hear about new bounties
* You are invited to our bi-weekly engineering calls with contributors
* You receive exclusive support and feedback 
and you have the option to earn tokens for your contributions.
