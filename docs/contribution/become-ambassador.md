#### You cannot get Near out of your head? - Then you are at the right place!
#### Become a Contributor and help Near consitently in building the NEAR Protcol!

The contributor program allows community members, groups and companies to collaborate on NEARâ€™s development efforts within their field of expertise. Projects are divided into four categories, event organisation, development, writing and education; each focusing on different tasks. Whether you are an individual, passionate contributing to open source projects, you are hosting a meetup group related to web3, or you want to help NEAR produce qualitative content, this program provides you with the support and resources to contribute.

## What you will be doing?

There are two options, you can either become involved as Contributor or as University Ambassador.

#### Contributor
You have the option to contribute to either or multiple of the following categories: development, event organisation, writing, or education. Efforts are centred around providing educational material about Web3, its social and economical implications, and development on NEAR. Additionally, you may be asked to collaborate with Near on bigger projects.

#### University Ambassador 
You are the NEAR representative at your University. Part of your efforts includes running educational events, providing introductions into the field of distributed ledger technologies and developing on blockchains. You can also discuss research, solutions, and running hackathons in collaboration with Near.
