# Promises

Transactions can be sent asynchronously from a contract through a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Like Promises in many programming languages, these will cause code to be executed in the future. In the case of NEAR, this "in the future" means a transaction to be executed _in the next block_ (or thereabouts), rather than in the same block as the original function call.

:::info Why wait?
Why not do these things synchronously, in the same block when the function is called? Why does NEAR require a `Promise` for sending tokens, or creating an account, or deploying a contract?

They need to be scheduled in separate blocks since sender and receiver accounts can be on different shards, and cross-shard communication happens across blocks by passing receipts (you can think of receipts in NEAR as "internal transactions"). You can see these receipts being passed from block to block [in NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/transactions/36n3tBNiF497Tm9mijEpsCUvejL8mBYF1CEWthCnY8FV).
