# Sending $NEAR

You might want to send tokens from a contract for many reasons.

- The contract uses something like the [Storage Standard](https://nomicon.io/Standards/StorageManagement) and needs to return deposits to users when they unregister.
- Users pay into the contract and the contract later pays these fees to the maintainers, redistributes them to users, or disburses them to some cause the users vote on.
- And more!

Blockchains give us programmable money, and the ability for a smart contract to send tokens lies at the heart of that ability.

NEAR makes this easy. Transferring NEAR tokens is the simplest transaction you can send from a smart contract. Here's all you need:

```js
let amount = BigInt(1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000); // 1 $NEAR as yoctoNEAR
let to = "alice.near";

NearPromise.new(to).transfer(amount);
```

In the context of a full contract and function call, this could look like:

```js
import { NearPromise, NearBindgen } from "near-sdk-js";

@NearBindgen({})
export class Contract {
  pay({ amount, to }) {
    return NearPromise.new(to).transfer(amount);
  }
}
```

Most of this is boilerplate you're probably familiar with by now – imports, setting up [`NearBindgen`](../contract-structure/near-bindgen.md), etc. Some interesting details related to the transfer itself:

- The `pay` method defined here accepts JSON as input, and numbers in JS [cannot be larger than `2^53-1`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER), so for compatibility with deserializing JSON to JS, the integer is serialized as a string. Since the `transfer` method takes a value in [yocto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto-)NEAR, it's likely to need numbers much larger than `2^53-1`.

- Returning the `NearPromise`: This allows NEAR Explorer, near-cli, near-api-js, and other tooling to correctly determine if a whole chain of transactions is successful. If your function does not return `Promise`, tools like near-cli will return immediately after your function call. And then even if the `transfer` fails, your function call will be considered successful.

Using near-cli, someone could invoke this function with a call like:

    near call $CONTRACT pay '{"amount": "1000000000000000000000000", "to": "example.near"}' --accountId root.near
