# Reducing a contract's size

## Advice & examples

This page is made for developers familiar with lower-level concepts who wish to reduce their contract size significantly, perhaps at the expense of code readability.

Some common scenarios where this approach may be helpful:

- contracts intended to be tied to one's account management
- contracts deployed using a factory
- future advancements similar to the EVM on NEAR

There have been a few items that may add unwanted bytes to a contract's size when compiled. Some of these may be more easily swapped for other approaches while others require more internal knowledge about system calls.

## Small wins

### Using flags

When compiling a contract make sure to pass flag `-C link-arg=-s` to the rust compiler:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Here is the parameters we use for the most examples in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "s"
lto = true
debug = false
panic = "abort"
overflow-checks = true
```

You may want to experiment with using `opt-level = "z"` instead of `opt-level = "s"` to see if generates a smaller binary. See more details on this in [The Cargo Book Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#opt-level). You may also reference this [Shrinking .wasm Size](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/code-size.html#tell-llvm-to-optimize-for-size-instead-of-speed) resource.

### Removing `rlib` from the manifest

Ensure that your manifest (`Cargo.toml`) doesn't contain `rlib` unless it needs to. Some NEAR examples have included this:

:::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```
:::

  when it could be:

:::tip

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

3. When using the Rust SDK, you may override the default JSON serialization to use [Borsh](https://borsh.io) instead. [See this page](contract-interface/serialization-interface.md#overriding-serialization-protocol-default) for more information and an example.
4. When using assertions or guards, avoid using the standard `assert` macros like [`assert!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert.html), [`assert_eq!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html), or [`assert_ne!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_ne.html) as these may add bloat for information regarding the line number of the error. There are similar issues with `unwrap`, `expect`, and Rust's `panic!()` macro.

  Example of a standard assertion:

  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

  ```rust
  assert_eq!(contract_owner, predecessor_account, "ERR_NOT_OWNER");
  ```
  :::

  when it could be:

  :::tip

  ```rust
  if contract_owner != predecessor_account {
    env::panic(b"ERR_NOT_OWNER");
  }
  ```
  :::

  Example of removing `expect`:

  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

  ```rust
  let owner_id = self.owner_by_id.get(&token_id).expect("Token not found");
  ```
  :::

  when it could be:

  :::tip

  ```rust
  fn expect_token_found<T>(option: Option<T>) -> T {
    option.unwrap_or_else(|| env::panic_str("Token not found"))
  }
  let owner_id = expect_token_found(self.owner_by_id.get(&token_id));  
  ```
  :::

  Example of changing standard `panic!()`:

  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

  ```rust
  panic!("ERR_MSG_HERE"); 
  ```
  :::

  when it could be:

  :::tip

  ```rust
  env::panic_str("ERR_MSG_HERE");  
  ```

## Lower-level approach

For a `no_std` approach to minimal contracts, observe the following examples:

- [Tiny contract](https://github.com/near/nearcore/tree/1e7c6613f65c23f87adf2c92e3d877f4ffe666ea/runtime/near-test-contracts/tiny-contract-rs)
- [NEAR ETH Gateway](https://github.com/ilblackdragon/near-eth-gateway/blob/master/proxy/src/lib.rs)
- [This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Hy4VBSCqnsE) where Eugene demonstrates a fungible token in `no_std` mode. The code for this [example lives here](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/pull/88).
- [Examples using a project called `nesdie`](https://github.com/austinabell/nesdie/tree/main/examples).
- Note that Aurora has found success using [rjson](https://crates.io/crates/rjson) as a lightweight JSON serialization crate. It has a smaller footprint than [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) which is currently packaged with the Rust SDK. See [this example of rjson](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/blob/65a1d11fcd16192cc1bda886c62005c603189a24/src/json.rs#L254) in an Aurora repository, although implementation details will have to be gleaned by the reader and won't be expanded upon here. [This nesdie example](https://github.com/austinabell/nesdie/blob/bb6beb77e32cd54077ac54bf028f262a9dfb6ad0/examples/multisig/src/utils/json/vector.rs#L26-L30) also uses the [miniserde crate](https://crates.io/crates/miniserde), which is another option to consider for folks who choose to avoid using the Rust SDK.
