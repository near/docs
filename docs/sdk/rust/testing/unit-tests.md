# Unit Tests

Testing contract functionality can be done through the `cargo test` framework. These tests will run with a mocked blockchain and will allow testing function calls directly without having to set up/deploy to a network and sign serialized transactions on this network.

A common framework for tests, along with setting up a basic testing environment looks like:

```rust
#[cfg(all(test, not(target_arch = "wasm32")))]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use near_sdk::test_utils::VMContextBuilder;
    use near_sdk::{testing_env, VMContext};

    fn get_context(is_view: bool) -> VMContext {
        VMContextBuilder::new()
            .signer_account_id("bob_near".parse().unwrap())
            .is_view(is_view)
            .build()
    }

    #[test]
    fn my_test() {
        let context = get_context(false);
        testing_env!(context);
        // ... Write test here
    }
}
```

Where `VMContextBuilder` allows for modifying the context of the mocked blockchain to simulate the environment that a transaction would be run. The documentation for what can be modified with this context can be found [here](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/struct.VMContext.html).

The `testing_env!` macro will initialize the blockchain interface with the `VMContext` which is either initialized through `VMContextBuilder` or manually through itself.

:::info Note

This `testing_env!` and `VMContext` is only used for testing outside of `wasm` environments. When running the built contract on a network in a `wasm` environment, the context from the blockchain will be used through host functions on the runtime.

:::

To test read-only function calls, set `is_view` to `true` on the `VMContext`. This will test to verify that function calls which just read state do not try to modify state through unit tests. In the above example, `true` should be passed into the `get_context` call, which initializes the context as read-only.

You will want to use `testing_env!` each time you need to update this context, such as mocking the `predecessor_accound_id` to simulate the functions being called by or only allowing view operations as mentioned above. Each time this is done, a new mocked blockchain will be initialized while keeping the existing state.
