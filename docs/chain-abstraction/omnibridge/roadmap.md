title: Omni Bridge Roadmap
---

Omni Bridge launches with a hybrid architecture, utilizing different verification methods based on chain-specific requirements and technical constraints. This approach allows us to support multiple chains from day one while progressively transitioning to full Chain Signatures integration.

## Supported Chains
Initial launch includes:

- **Ethereum** - _(Light client + Chain Signatures)_
- **Bitcoin** - _(Light client + Chain Signatures)_
- **Solana** - _(Currently Wormhole, transitioning to Chain Signatures)_
- **Base** - _(Currently Wormhole, transitioning to Chain Signatures)_
- **Arbitrum** - _(Currently Wormhole, transitioning to Chain Signatures)_

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1: Hybrid Operation**
- ETH/BTC: Light client verification
- Other chains: Wormhole message passing
- All NEAR outbound: Chain Signatures

During this phase, cross-chain messages follow different verification paths depending on direction and chain. NEAR outbound transfers already utilize Chain Signatures, while inbound transfers vary by source chain.

2. **Phase 2: Full Chain Signatures**
- Progressive transition of all chains
- Removal of Wormhole dependency
- Enhanced decentralization

Phase 2 represents our move to a unified verification model. Each chain will transition to Chain Signatures verification as implementation and audits complete, gradually removing the hybrid architecture's complexity.

## Future Development
1. **Protocol Improvements**
- Enhanced fee mechanisms
- Cross-chain contract calls
- New token standards support

Beyond basic asset transfers, we're expanding the bridge's capabilities. Enhanced fee mechanisms will better handle gas price volatility, while cross-chain contract calls will enable more complex interactions.

2. **Infrastructure**
- Expanded relayer network
- Improved monitoring tools
- Enhanced developer tooling

Infrastructure development focuses on reliability and usability. An expanded relayer network improves transfer speeds and reliability, while better monitoring and developer tools make integration and maintenance easier.
