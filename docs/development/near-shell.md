## Overview

NEAR CLI is a fully featured NodeJS command line interface that wraps `near-api-js`.

You use NEAR CLI to connect to the NEAR platform from the terminal to create accounts, deploy contracts and more.

**Prerequisites: Make sure you have the latest version npm and node**

## Installation

### Mac and Linux

* `npm` (Get it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))
* `node` version 12.x or greater (Get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

To install NEAR CLI globally (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

### Windows

Please use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

1. Download a [distro from this Microsoft link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distros).
2. Install Node.js [following the directions here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
3. We will be installing `near-cli` globally and Windows is known to have permission issues with this in WSL. Follow the [guide here](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory) in order to fix this issue.
4. Now we can run the same command as Mac and Linux:

```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

**Note**: Copy/pasting can be a bit odd using WSL. Quick Edit Mode will allow right-click pasting. Depending on your version there may be another checkbox allowing Ctrl+V pasting as well.

## Upgrade

If an upgrade is available, NEAR CLI will present a notice similar to the following: 

![NEAR CLI detects a new version](/docs/assets/near-shell-upgrade-notice.png)

To upgrade NEAR CLI, just follow the instructions

```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

If you're curious, you can always check your current version before and after the upgrade with

```bash
near --version  # version info appears on the last line of output
```

And you can always see the latest available version using

```bash
npm outdated -g  # note the difference between Current and Latest
```

But NEAR CLI handles upgrade notification automatically.

If you have any issues upgrading NEAR CLI, sometimes the fastest way to resolve the issue is to uninstall / reinstall

```bash
npm uninstall -g near-cli
npm install -g near-cli
```

## Usage

In command line, from directory with your project:

```bash
near <command>
```

### Commands

#### For accounts:
```bash
near login                                       # logging in through NEAR protocol wallet

near state <accountId>                           # view account state
near keys <accountId>                            # view account public keys

near clean                                       # clean the smart contract build locally (remove ./out )
```

#### For transactions:
```bash
near tx-status <hash>                            # lookup transaction status by hash
```

#### Other:

```bash
near repl                                        # launch interactive Node.js shell with NEAR connection available to use
