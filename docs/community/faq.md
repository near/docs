### What is NEAR? {#what-is-near}

#### Non-blockchain answer: {#non-blockchain-answer}
It’s a community-operated Cloud, providing a platform for building open source and open state applications.

#### Blockchain answer: {#blockchain-answer}
It’s a decentralized application platform running on its own blockchain, that solves usability and scaling via sharding.

### What is the difference between NEAR Inc and the NEAR Protocol? {#what-is-the-difference-between-near-inc-and-the-near-protocol}
Generally, we differentiate between many of the different entities who are building the NEAR platform. Two of those different entities are the NEAR Foundation and NEAR Inc.

#### The NEAR Protocol {#the-near-protocol}
A permissionless, Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol that anyone can access, add transactions to, or read from. The public NEAR blockchain is an instantiation of the reference code at http://github.com/near/nearcore, but theoretically, this repo could be forked and deployed as a separate chain, as much as many protocols have done to build upon the core Bitcoin code.

#### The NEAR Foundation {#the-near-foundation}
A non-profit foundation headquartered in Switzerland, and is responsible for contracting protocol maintainers, funding ecosystem development, and shepherding core governance of the protocol.

#### NEAR Inc {#near-inc}
A US-based software research and development company that did much of the early development of the protocol and its tooling. While NEAR Inc does not own or run the NEAR Protocol (which is decentralized), it continues to propose changes to the reference implementation codebase as one of multiple third-party entities performing R&D work for the protocol.

### Who is building the NEAR Protocol? {#who-is-building-the-near-protocol}
Much of the early development of the protocol and its tooling has been done by NEAR Inc.
