Welcome! If you are in this repository, you are probably interested in contributing to NEAR's development.

We have tons of open issues across repositories and regularly post [bounties](https://github.com/near/bounties).

To learn more about the contribution flow for developers, please head over to the [Developer Contributions walkthrough](/docs/community/contribute/how-to-contribute).

## Contributor Program

If you like contributing to NEAR and would like to get formally involved with continuous contributions, the [contributor program](https://near.org/contributor/) is the right place for you.

As part of the NEAR contributor program

- You are the first to hear about new bounties
- You are invited to our bi-weekly engineering calls with contributors
- You receive exclusive support and feedback
  and you have the option to earn tokens for your contributions.
