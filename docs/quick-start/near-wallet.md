## Try NEAR Wallet

https://wallet.testnet.near.org

Note that this wallet runs on Testnet. Upon signing up, you are provided with 10 NEAR tokens. Since these tokens are issued on Testnet, they are kind of like fake tokens that allow you to experiment with our development environment, deploy smart contracts and make transactions.

For more information on how to sign-up, please follow our [guide](/docs/local-setup/create-account).
