title: RPC Providers
---

There are multiple RPC providers from which you can choose from. These providers will work as intermediaries to help you interact with the NEAR network.
Depending on where the provider is located you'll experience different latency levels. You can potentially use multiple providers for redundancy and
balancing.

:::tip

If you want to use a custom RPC provider with NEAR Wallet Selector, [check this example](../../2.develop/integrate/frontend.md#setting-customs-rpc-endpoints).
