## Background {#background}

Implicit accounts work similarly to Bitcoin/Ethereum accounts.
 - They allow you to reserve an account ID before it's created by generating a ED25519 key-pair locally.
 - This key-pair has a public key that maps to the account ID.
 - The account ID is a lowercase hex representation of the public key.
 - An ED25519 Public key contains 32 bytes that maps to 64 characters account ID.
 - The corresponding secret key allows you to sign transactions on behalf of this account once it's created on chain.

## Creating an account locally {#creating-an-account-locally}

For the purpose of this demo, we'll use the `betanet` network. 

## Set `betanet` network {#set-betanet-network}

```bash
export NEAR_ENV=betanet
```

## Generating the Implicit account

```bash
near account create-account fund-later use-auto-generation save-to-folder ~/.near-credentials/implicit
```

Example Output
```
The file "~/.near-credentials/testnet/8bca86065be487de45e795b2c3154fe834d53ffa07e0a44f29e76a2a5f075df8.json" was saved successfully

Here is your console command if you need to script it or re-run:
    near account create-account fund-later use-auto-generation save-to-folder ~/.near-credentials/implicit
```

## Using the Implicit Account
We can export our account ID to a bash env variable:
```bash
export ACCOUNT="8bca86065be487de45e795b2c3154fe834d53ffa07e0a44f29e76a2a5f075df8"
```

Assuming you've received tokens on your new account, you can transfer from it using the following command:

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">

  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  near send $ACCOUNT <receiver> <amount>
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

  ```bash
  near tokens $ACCOUNT send-near <receiver> '<amount> NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Transferring to the implicit account {#transferring-to-the-implicit-account}

Let's say someone gives you their account ID `0861ea8ddd696525696ccf3148dd706c4fda981c64d8a597490472594400c223`. You can just transfer to it by running:

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">

  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  near send <your_account_id> 0861ea8ddd696525696ccf3148dd706c4fda981c64d8a597490472594400c223 <amount>
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

  ```bash
  near tokens<your_account_id> send-near 0861ea8ddd696525696ccf3148dd706c4fda981c64d8a597490472594400c223 '<amount> NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## BONUS: Converting public key using python (for learning purposes) {#bonus-converting-public-key-using-python-for-learning-purposes}

For this flow we'll use `python3` (with version `3.5+`) with `base58` library.

You can install this library with `pip3`:
```bash
pip3 install --user base58
```

Start python3 interpreter:
```bash
python3
```

The first thing is to get the data part from the public key (without `ed25519:` prefix). Let's store it in a variable `pk58`:
```python
pk58 = 'BGCCDDHfysuuVnaNVtEhhqeT4k9Muyem3Kpgq2U1m9HX'
```

Now let's import base58:
```python
import base58
```

Finally, let's convert our base58 public key representation to bytes and then to hex:
```python
base58.b58decode(pk58).hex()
```

Output:
```
'98793cd91a3f870fb126f66285808c7e094afcfc4eda8a970f6648cdf0dbd6de'
```

This gives us the same account ID as `near-cli`, so this is encouraging.

**Note:** The default network for `near-cli` is `testnet`. If you would like to change this to `mainnet` or `betanet`, please see [`near-cli` network selection](/tools/near-cli#network-selection) for instructions.
