To integrate NEAR to your frontend, you will leverage two tools:

1. `Wallet Selector`: Enables the user to select their preferred NEAR wallet in your dApp.
2. `NEAR API JS`: A suite of tools to interact with the NEAR RPC.

Using those tools, you will implement the following flow:

1. **Setup** a wallet selector.
1. Load the wallet selector **on start-up**.
2. Ask the user to **sign-in** using a NEAR wallet.
2. **Call methods** in the contract.

You can optionally use [Naxios](https://wpdas.gitbook.io/naxios). A promise-based NEAR Contract and NEAR Wallet Client for browser.

Naxios was designed to facilitate the React / Next.js integration with NEAR Blockchain and avoid the boilerplate of setting up a wallet and contract.

## Adding NEAR API JS and Wallet Selector
As a popular framework [our examples](https://github.com/near-examples/) are based on **Next.js** so, we will go through the steps to integrate NEAR to a default Next.js project and interact with the `hello-near` example contract.

Apart of `near-api-js` and the `wallet-selector` core package we will also add the optional `modal-ui` and the provided `react-hook` (more info on [wallet-selector repo](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/)) as well as few of the popular wallet providers.

If you prefer to explore the complete code example, you can check the [hello-near-example](https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/tree/main/frontend) repository.

```bash
npm install \
  near-api-js \
  @near-wallet-selector/core \
  @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui \
  @near-wallet-selector/react-hook \
  @near-wallet-selector/bitte-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/ledger \
  @near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/nightly
```
:::tip

The wallet selector supports multiple wallet packages to select from, [see the full list on the Repo](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector#installation-and-usage).
We cover how to support Ethereum wallets in the next section: [Ethereum Wallets on Near](ethereum-wallets.md)
:::

---

## Initialize Wallet Selector

```jsx title="_app.js"
import { setupBitteWallet } from "@near-wallet-selector/bitte-wallet";
import { setupLedger } from "@near-wallet-selector/ledger";
import { setupMeteorWallet } from "@near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet";
import { setupNightly } from "@near-wallet-selector/nightly";
import { WalletSelectorProvider } from "@near-wallet-selector/react-hook";

const walletSelectorConfig = {
  network: "testnet", // "mainnet"
  // Optional: createAccessKeyFor: "hello.near-examples.testnet",
  modules: [
    setupBitteWallet(),
    setupMeteorWallet(),
    setupLedger(),
    setupNightly()
  ],
}

export default function App({ Component }) {
  return (
    <WalletSelectorProvider config={walletSelectorConfig}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </WalletSelectorProvider>
  );
}
```
<details markdown="1" id="setting-customs-rpc-endpoints">

<summary>Setting custom RPC endpoints</summary>

If you want to use a user-defined RPC endpoint with the Wallet Selector, you can set up a [network options](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/tree/main/packages/core#options) object with the custom URLs.
For example:


```js
const my_network = {
  networkId: "my-custom-network",
  nodeUrl: "https://rpc.custom-rpc.com",
  helperUrl: "https://helper.custom-helper.com",
  explorerUrl: "https://custom-explorer.com",
  indexerUrl: "https://api.custom-indexer.com",
};
```

:::tip

You can find the entire Wallet Selector [API reference here](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/blob/main/packages/core/docs/api/selector.md).

:::

</details>

#### Optional: `createAccessKeyFor`

When initializing the wallet-selector, you can choose to **create a [Function-Call Key](/protocol/access-keys#function-call-keys)** using the `createAccessKeyFor` parameter.

By creating this key, your dApp will be able to **automatically sign non-payable transactions** on behalf of the user for specified contract.

---

## Calling View Methods

Once the wallet-selector is up, we can start calling view methods, i.e., the methods that perform read-only operations.

Because of their read-only nature, view methods are **free** to call, and do **not require** the user to be **logged in**.

  <Language value="js" language="jsx">
    <Github fname="index.js"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/hello-near/index.js" start="19" end="20" />
  </Language>


The snippet above shows how we call view methods in our examples. Under the hood: we are actually making a **direct call to the RPC** using `near-api-js`.

:::tip

View methods have by default 200 TGAS for execution

:::

---

## User Sign-In / Sign-Out

In order to interact with non-view methods it is necessary for the user to first sign in using a NEAR wallet.

We can request the user sign in if `signedAccountId` is not present, the same simplicity applies to signing out.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="jsx">
    <Github fname="navigation.js"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/components/navigation.js"
            start="9" end="38" />

    <Github fname="_app.js"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/_app.js"
            start="43" end="46" />

  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

When the user clicks the `login` button, they will be asked to select a wallet and use it to log in.

<hr className="subsection" />

### Function Call Key

If you instantiated the `wallet-selector` passing an account id for the `createAccessKeyFor` parameter, then the wallet will create a [Function-Call Key](/protocol/access-keys#function-call-keys) and store it in the web's local storage.

```js
const walletSelectorConfig = {
  network: "testnet", // "mainnet"
  createAccessKeyFor: "hello.near-examples.testnet",
  modules: [
  ...
  ],
}
```

By default, such key enables to expend a maximum of `0.25â“ƒ` on GAS calling methods in **the specified** contract **without prompting** the user to sign them.

If, on the contrary, you do not create an access key, then the user will be asked to sign every single transaction (except calls to `view methods`, since those are always free).

:::tip

Please notice that this only applies to **non-payable** methods, if you attach deposit to any call the user will **always** be redirected to the wallet to confirm the transaction.

:::

---

## Calling Change Methods

Once the user logs in they can start calling `change methods`. Programmatically, calling `change methods` is similar to calling `view methods`, only that now you can attach deposit to the call, and specify how much GAS you want to use.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
    <Github fname="index.js"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/hello-near/index.js"
            start="26" end="39" />
</Language>

</CodeTabs>

Under the hood, we are asking the **signedAccountId** to **sign a Function-Call transaction** for us.

:::tip

Remember that you can use the `callFunction` to call methods in **any** contract. If you did not ask for a function call key to be created, the user will simply be prompted to confirm the transaction.

:::

<hr className="subsection" />

## Sending Multiple Transactions

The wallet-selector hook also exposes a method that can be used to send multiple transactions.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
  ```js
  ...
  const { signAndSendTransactions } = useWalletSelector();

  const txs = await signAndSendTransactions({
      transactions: [{
          receiverId: "hello.near-examples.testnet",
          actions: [{
              type: "FunctionCall",
              params: {
                  methodName: "set_greeting",
                  args: {
                      greeting: "Hello World"
                  },
                  gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
                  deposit: NO_DEPOSIT
              }
          }]
      }
      ...
      ]
  });
  ```
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

Transactions can either be sent as multiple separate transactions simultaneously or as a batch transaction made up of actions where if one of the actions fails, they are all reverted. An example of both can be seen [here](/tutorials/examples/frontend-multiple-contracts#dispatching-multiple-transactions)

---
## Signing Messages


<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
  ```js
  ...
  const { signMessage } = useWalletSelector();

  const sign = await signMessage({ message, recipient, nonce });

  ```
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

---

## Querying Account Balance

By calling the `getBalance` method the user can get the balance of a given account.

 <Language value="js" language="js">
 ```js
  ...
  const { getBalance } = useWalletSelector();

  const balance = await getBalance("account.testnet");
```
</Language>


---

## Get Access Keys

The final method the the wallet selector hooks exposes is `getAccessKeys` which is used to return an object of all the access keys on the account that is currently logged in.

<Language value="js" language="js">
```js
...
const { getAccessKeys } = useWalletSelector();

const keys = await getAccessKeys("account.testnet");
```
</Language>

---

## Handling Data Types

When calling methods in a contract or receiving results from them, you will need to encode/decode parameters correctly. For this, it is important to know how the contracts encode timestamps (u64) and deposit amounts (u128).

##### Time

The block timestamp in a smart contract is encoded using nanoseconds (i.e. 19 digits: `1655373910837593990`). In contrast, `Date.now()` from javascript returns a timestamp in milliseconds (i.e 13 digits: `1655373910837`). Make sure to convert between milliseconds and nanoseconds to properly handle time variables.

##### Deposits

Smart contracts speak in yocto NEAR, where 1â“ƒ = 10^24yocto, and the values are always encoded as `strings`.

- Convert from NEAR to yocto before sending it to the contract using `near-api-js.utils.format.parseNearAmount(amount.toString())`.
- Convert a response in yoctoNEAR to NEAR using `near-api-js.utils.format.formatNearAmount(amount)`

:::tip

If the contract returns a `Balance` instead of a `U128`, you will get a "scientific notation" `number` instead of a `string` (e.g. `10^6` instead of `"1000000"`). In this case, you can convert the value to NEAR by doing:

```js
function formatAmount(amount) {
  let formatted = amount.toLocaleString("fullwide", { useGrouping: false })
  formatted = utils.format.formatNearAmount(formatted)

  return Math.floor(formatted * 100) / 100
}
```

## Leveraging NEAR API JS

NEAR API JS does not limit itself to simply calling methods in a contract. In fact, you can use it to transform your web-app into a rich user experience. While we will not cover these topics in depth, it is important for you to know that with NEAR API JS you can also:

- **[Sign and verify messages](./backend/backend.md)**: this is very useful for proving that a message was created by the user.
- **[Create batch transactions](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/tree/master/packages/cookbook/transactions/batch-transactions.ts)**: this enables to link multiple [actions](../protocol/transaction-anatomy.md#actions) (e.g. multiple function calls). If one of the transactions fails, then they are all reverted.
- **[Create accounts](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/tree/master/packages/cookbook/accounts/create-testnet-account.ts)**: deploy accounts for your users!

Check the [NEAR API](../tools/near-api.md) section to learn how to supercharge your web-app.

:::note Versioning for this article

At the time of this writing, this example works with the following versions:

- next: `15.0.3`
- near-api-js: `^5.0.1`
- wllet-selector/core: `^8.10.0`
