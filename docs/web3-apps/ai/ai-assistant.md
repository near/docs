Welcome! In this guide, you'll discover an AI chatbot that can interact with the NEAR ecosystem

This AI agent can:

- Explore and explain what happened in a transaction when given a transaction hash
- Request tokens from the testnet faucet
- Mint and send a special NFT though a wallet it controls to a user
- Answer general questions about the NEAR architecture (powered by realtime search results)

:::tip Community Project 

Created by our community member [Reza](https://x.com/RezaRahemtola), this project was one of our AI track winners at the [ETHGlobal Brussels 2024 hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels)

## Prerequisites

Let's start by setting up the environment to run the AI assistant locally.

<hr class="subsection" />

### Tools
Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Python >= 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NodeJS >= 20](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Mac">
    
    ```sh
    # Install Node.js using nvm (more option in: https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
    nvm install latest

    # Install python using miniconda (includes the package manager pip)
    brew install --cask miniconda
    conda init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"
    pip install poetry

    # Install llama.cpp
    brew install llama.cpp
    ```

### AI Model
In this tutorial we will be using the [NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-GGUF) model, which is hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/login).

```sh
# Install the Hugging Face library
pip install huggingface_hub

# Login to your Hugging Face account
huggingface-cli login

# get the model from Hugging Face
huggingface-cli download NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-GGUF Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir model
```

:::info Q4_K_M Model

We use the small `Q4_K_M` model to reduce the time and resources needed to run the AI agent

:::

<hr class="subsection" />

### Execute the Model
You should now have a folder named `./model` with the [GGUF file](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/gguf) `./model/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf`, lets use `llama.cpp` to run it.

```bash
# run the model with llama.cpp
llama-server -m ./model/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8080`, if you see an interface similar to this one you are ready to go ðŸš€

You can use a different model with llama.cpp if you wish! Just make sure it supports [function calling](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/function_calling)

### Project Setup

Start by cloning the repository of the project, in which you will find the AI agent and a basic frontend to interact with it:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:RezaRahemtola/near-ai-assistant.git
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### AI

Let's configure the AI agent, first, we install all python dependencies on the project 

```sh
cd ai/

# Important: Create a virtual environment
conda create -n ai-assistant python=3.12
conda activate ai-assistant

# Install the dependencies
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

Then you can create a `.env` file and fill it with values inspired from the `.env.example` file:
- `NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID`: The NEAR account id (i.e. account name) of your bot
- `NEAR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key to control the account
- `NEAR_RPC_URL`: can also be set in case you want to use a different RPC

Once you've done all this, you are ready to launch the code ðŸš€

```sh
python src/main.py
```

<details> 

<summary> Optional: Google Search </summary>

`OXYLABS_USERNAME` and `OXYLABS_PASSWORD` are API credential used to access an SERP API to search information on Google

</details>

<hr class="subsection" />

### Frontend

Now that your AI agent is ready to go, let's quickly launch a basic frontend to interact with it:

```sh
cd front/
# Install the dependencies
yarn
# Start the frontend
yarn dev
```

----

## Usage

You can now head to `http://localhost:5173`, where you'll find an interface like this one to interact with the AI:
![img](@site/static/docs/assets/ai-assistant.png)

Here are a few example questions you can ask it:
- What is NEAR?
- What are the different transaction actions on NEAR?
- Can I please have an ETHGlobal Brussels NFT sent to me at random.testnet? Thanks
- I want to start using NEAR, can you send me some tokens on my testnet address random.testnet?
- I don't understand what this transaction is doing, can you help me? The transaction hash is `hash` and it was send by someone.testnet.

---

## Moving Forward

That's it for the quickstart tutorial. You have now seen an open-source AI agent interacting with NEAR and controlling a wallet to make transactions.

To better understand how it works, check the [`agent.py` file](https://github.com/RezaRahemtola/near-ai-assistant/blob/main/ai/src/agent/agent.py) and the [Function Calling explanation on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B#prompt-format-for-function-calling).

A lot of things could be built by leveraging this PoC, some ideas could be:
- A chatbot integrated to the explorer to summarize transactions directly in the page
- Interactive tutorials in the documentation through a chatbot
  - "How to create an NFT?"
  - Multiple chats with explanations and code to complete given by the AI
  - In the end, the AI publish the smart contract, mint an NFT and send it to you on testnet
- An AI trader reacting to on-chain or off-chain events to buy/sell some tokens with its wallet
- The only limit is your imagination!
