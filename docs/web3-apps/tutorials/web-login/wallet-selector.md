Allowing your users to connect with their favorite wallet and interact with your dApp is a crucial step in building web3 applications. This guide will help you to integrate the `Wallet Selector` into your frontend, enabling users to sign-in and perform transactions using their NEAR wallet.

:::tip

To see a fully working example, check our [Hello NEAR Example](https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/frontend), a simple app that allows users to set and get a greeting message on the NEAR blockchain

## Adding the Wallet Selector

To start, you will need to add the `Wallet Selector` and its dependencies to your project.

If you prefer to explore the complete code example, you can check the [hello-near-example](https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/tree/main/frontend) repository:

```bash
npm install \
  @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui \
  @near-wallet-selector/bitget-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/coin98-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/ethereum-wallets \
  @near-wallet-selector/hot-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/intear-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/ledger \
  @near-wallet-selector/math-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet-app \
  @near-wallet-selector/near-mobile-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/okx-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/ramper-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/sender \
  @near-wallet-selector/unity-wallet \
  @near-wallet-selector/welldone-wallet
```

Notice that the wallet selector implements multiple wallet packages to select from, [see the full list on the Repo](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)

## Initialize the Selector

To initialize the wallet selector, you will need to set it up in your main application file (e.g., `app.js` or `index.js`). You can choose which wallets to include in the selector by importing their respective setup functions and adding them to the `modules` array.

```jsx title="app.js"
import { setupBitteWallet } from "@near-wallet-selector/bitte-wallet";
import { setupLedger } from "@near-wallet-selector/ledger";
import { setupMeteorWallet } from "@near-wallet-selector/meteor-wallet";
import { setupNightly } from "@near-wallet-selector/nightly";
import { WalletSelectorProvider } from "@near-wallet-selector/react-hook";

const walletSelectorConfig = {
  network: "testnet", // "mainnet"
  // Optional: createAccessKeyFor: "hello.near-examples.testnet",
  modules: [
    setupBitteWallet(),
    setupMeteorWallet(),
    setupLedger(),
    setupNightly()
  ],
}

export default function App({ Component }) {
  return (
    <WalletSelectorProvider config={walletSelectorConfig}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </WalletSelectorProvider>
  );
}
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### Custom RPC

If you want to use a user-defined RPC endpoint with the Wallet Selector, you can set up a [network options](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/tree/main/packages/core#options) object with the custom URLs.
For example:


```js
const my_network = {
  networkId: "my-custom-network",
  nodeUrl: "https://rpc.custom-rpc.com",
  helperUrl: "https://helper.custom-helper.com",
  explorerUrl: "https://custom-explorer.com",
  indexerUrl: "https://api.custom-indexer.com",
};
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### Creating an Access Key

If you instantiated the `wallet-selector` passing an account id for the `createAccessKeyFor` parameter, then the wallet will create a [Function-Call Key](/protocol/access-keys#function-call-keys) and store it in the web's local storage.

```js
const walletSelectorConfig = {
  network: "testnet", // "mainnet"
  createAccessKeyFor: "hello.near-examples.testnet",
  modules: [
    setupMeteorWallet()
    // ...
  ],
}
```

By default, such key enables to expend a maximum of `0.25â“ƒ` on GAS calling methods in **the specified** contract **without prompting** the user to sign them.

If, on the contrary, you do not create an access key, then the user will be asked to sign every single transaction (except calls to `view methods`, since those are always free).

:::tip

Please notice that this only applies to **non-payable** methods, if you attach deposit to any call the user will **always** be redirected to the wallet to confirm the transaction.

:::

---

## Calling View Methods

Once the wallet-selector is up, we can start calling view methods, i.e., the methods that perform read-only operations.

Because of their read-only nature, view methods are **free** to call, and do **not require** the user to be **logged in**. To make a view call, you simply need to import the `viewFunction` from the wallet selector hooks:

<Language value="js" language="tsx">
  <Github fname="index.tsx"
    url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/hello-near/index.tsx" start="11" end="11"  />
</Language>

Then, you can call any view method from any contract by providing the `contractId`, `methodName`, and arguments (`args`):

<Language value="js" language="tsx">
  <Github fname="index.tsx"
    url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/hello-near/index.tsx" start="18" end="20"  />
</Language>

Under the hood, `viewFunction`  is actually making a **direct call to the RPC** using `near-api-js`.

:::tip

View methods have by default 200 TGAS for execution

## User Sign-In / Sign-Out

In order to interact with methods that modify data or make cross-contract calls it is necessary for the user to first sign in using a NEAR wallet.

We can request the user sign in if `signedAccountId` is not present, the same simplicity applies to signing out.

<Github fname="navigation.js" language="js"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/components/navigation.tsx"
        start="12" end="22" />

By assigning the `signIn` action to a button, when the user clicks it, the wallet selector modal will open:

```jsx
<button onClick={action}>{label}</button>
```

---

## Calling Change Methods

Once the user logs in they can start calling `change methods`. Programmatically, calling `change methods` is similar to calling `view methods`, only that now you can attach deposit to the call, and specify how much GAS you want to use.

<Github fname="index.js" language="js"
  url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/hello-near/index.tsx"
  start="26" end="39" />

Under the hood, we are asking the **signedAccountId** to **sign a Function-Call transaction** for us.

:::tip

Remember that you can use the `callFunction` to call methods in **any** contract. If you did not ask for a function call key to be created, the user will simply be prompted to confirm the transaction.

## Sending Multiple Transactions

The wallet-selector hook also exposes a method that can be used to send multiple transactions at once:

```js
const { signAndSendTransactions } = useWalletSelector();

const txs = await signAndSendTransactions({
    transactions: [{
        receiverId: "hello.near-examples.testnet",
        actions: [{
            type: "FunctionCall",
            params: {
                methodName: "set_greeting",
                args: {
                    greeting: "Hello World"
                },
                gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
                deposit: NO_DEPOSIT
            }
        }]
    }]
});
```

Transactions can either be sent as multiple separate transactions simultaneously or as a batch transaction made up of actions where if one of the actions fails, they are all reverted. 

An example of both can be seen [here](../../../tutorials/examples/frontend-multiple-contracts#dispatching-multiple-transactions).

## Querying Account Balance

By calling the `getBalance` method the user can get the balance of a given account.

```js
const { getBalance } = useWalletSelector();

const balance = await getBalance("account.testnet");
```


---

## Get Access Keys

The final method the wallet selector hooks exposes is `getAccessKeys`, which is used to return an object of all the access keys on the account that is currently logged in.

```js
const { getAccessKeys } = useWalletSelector();

const keys = await getAccessKeys("account.testnet");
```
