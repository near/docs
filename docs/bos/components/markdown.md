      <div class="container border border-info pt-3  text-center">
        <Markdown text={placement} />
      </div>
    ))}
  </>
);
```

## Markdown Editor

The user can input static text, as demonstrated above. However, for a more robust experience, checkout this component that also contains a [Markdown Editor](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/MarkdownEditorIframeExample). Hit the `View Source` Button to see how this editor was created.
