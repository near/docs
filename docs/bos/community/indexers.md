With QueryAPI you can quickly create your own indexer by:

* Writing your own custom indexer function;
* Specifying the schema for your own custom hosted database and write to it with your indexer function;
* Retrieving that data through a GraphQL API.

### How it Works

This works by:

1. Writing the indexer name to the blockchain, registering its creation;
2. Creating the tables as specified in the schema to the GraphQL database, exposing a GraphQL endpoint to query the data;
3. Spinning up a cloud process that runs your indexer function, writing to the GraphQL database;

You can access the [NEAR QueryAPI by following this link](https://near.org/dataplatform.near/widget/QueryApi.App).

This should take you to a dashboard that looks like this:

## Creating an Indexer

Clicking on "Create New Indexer" will redirect you in-browser to a Component code editor that looks like this:

![QueryAPI Indexer Dashboard](./assets/QAPIScreen2.png)

This is the interface through which you can create a new Indexer. On here you can specify:

* the filtering, transforming logic in `indexingLogic.js`
* the database schema in `schema.sql`
* the GraphQL queries in `GraphiQL`
* the indexer name on Indexer Name
* from which block to start indexing on Specific Block Height or From Latest Block Height (selected by default)

### `IndexingLogic.js`

The indexer code editor is pre-populated with a template that looks like this:

```js
import { Block } from "@near-lake/primitives";
/**
 * Note: We only support javascript at the moment. We will support Rust, Typescript in a further release.
 */

/**
 * getBlock(block, context) applies your custom logic to a Block on Near and commits the data to a database.
 *
 * Learn more about indexers here:  https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/indexers
 *
 * @param {block} Block - A Near Protocol Block
 * @param {context} - A set of helper methods to retrieve and commit state
 */
async function getBlock(block: Block, context) {
  // Add your code here
  const h = block.header().height;
  await context.set("height", h);
}
```

This editor with this code shows the `indexingLogic.js` file that is selected. This logic in particular will perform the filtering of blockchain transactions, transforming and saving the data you specify to a GraphQL database you define in `schema.sql`.

:::tip Note

You will likely want to save the data you capture from your indexer to your defined tables in the GraphQL database. You can do this by inserting GraphQL mutation queries in your `indexingLogic.js` file. For example, if you have a table called `transactions` with columns `id`, `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, `block_height`, you can insert a mutation query for one new element in the table like this:

```js
await context.graphql(`
  mutation MyMutation($transaction: some_table_insert_input!) {
    insert_<ACCOUNT_NAME>_near_transactions_one(
      object: $transaction
    ) {
      affected_rows
    }
  }
`);
```

Creating these queries within strings can be very difficult, especially considering that the table names vary depending on your indexer name and account ID. An easier way to do this would be by visiting the GraphQL Playground site and creating the queries there. You can then copy and paste them into your `indexingLogic.js` file as shown below:

### `schema.sql`

This tab in the editor will be pre-populated with a template that looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "indexer_storage" (
  "function_name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "key_name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "value" TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY ("function_name", "key_name")
);
```

This is the database schema that will be used to store the data you specify in `indexingLogic.js`. You can add more tables and columns to this schema as you see fit. They will be created as soon as you create the indexer.

:::warning Note
You are able to update `indexingLogic.js` after you have registered/created your indexer, but you are only allowed to specify `schema.sql` once before you submit your indexer. If you want to update your schema, you will have to create a new indexer.
:::

Creating this default table will allow you to use the `context.set` helper method to write data. It takes two arguments: a key argument and a value argument,  which will be written to the `key_name` and `value` columns.

### `GraphiQL`

The GraphiQL tab in the editor will allow you to view the returned data from your GraphQL endpoint. This is best verified after you have created the indexer.

### Performing Queries on the Public GraphQL API

In this section, we will provide a brief overview of how to query from a component in BOS.

It is helpful to create a helper method which will allow us to fetch from our GraphQL API. Let's call it`fetchGraphQL`. It takes three parameters:

1. `queriesDoc`: A string containing the queries you would like to execute.
2. `queryName`: The specific query you want to run.
3. `variables`: Any variables to pass in that your query supports, such as `offset` and `limit` for pagination.

```javascript
function fetchGraphQL(queriesDoc, queryName, variables) {
  return asyncFetch(
    QUERY_API_ENDPOINT,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "x-hasura-role": `<your_account_name>_near` },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        queries: queriesDoc,
        variables: variables,
        operationName: queryName,
      }),
    }
  );
}
```

To use the `fetchGraphQL` function, first define a string of queries, e.g `transactionQueriesDoc` containing your desired queries:

```javascript
const transactionQueriesDoc = `query TransactionsQuery {
  root_near_transactions {
    id
    sender
    receiver
    amount
    block_height
  }
}
...
query AnotherQuery {
  root_near_accounts {
    id
  }
}`;
```

Next, call the `fetchGraphQL` function with the appropriate parameters and process the results. In this example, we fetch transaction data and update the application state:

```javascript
fetchGraphQL(transactionQueriesDoc, "TransactionsQuery", {})
  .then((result) => {
    if (result.status === 200) {
      let data = result.body.data;
      if (data) {
        const transactions = data.root_near_transactions;
        // Perform any necessary operations on the fetched data
        ...
        // Update state with the new transactions data
        State.update({
          transactions: transactions,
        });
      }
    }
  });
```

We have just shown how to fetch data from the indexers that we have created from within the BOS. To view a more complex example, see this widget which fetches posts with proper pagination: [Posts Widget powered By QueryAPI](https://near.org/edit/roshaan.near/widget/query-api-feed-infinite).
