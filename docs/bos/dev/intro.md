title: BOS Dev Tools
---

Building, deploying, and collaborating within a new framework can be challenging. The NEAR community has created helpful workflows using new tools to simplify your development workflow building on the [Blockchain Operating System](https://near.org/blog/near-announces-the-blockchain-operating-system/) (BOS).

## Local Tools

The quickest way to start building on the BOS is by using the [in-browser editor](https://near.org/sandbox). If you want to collaborate with a team on a larger project, you will likely want more version control, automated testing, deployment, and other workflows you're used to. We've compiled a list below to supercharge your local project development:

- [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs): a command line utility that simplifies local component development for NEAR BOS.
- [BOS Loader](bos-loader.md): a CLI tool to preview local components in NEAR BOS. A perfect companion to [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs).
- [VS Code Extension](vscode.md): an extension to help you develop components using VS Code
- [Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai): a web IDE made for BOS developers
