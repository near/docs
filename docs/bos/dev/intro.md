title: Setup your Dev Environment
---

Building, deploying, and collaborating within a new framework can be challenging. The NEAR community has created helpful workflows using new tools to simplify your development workflow.

---

## Web Tools
The quickest way to start building NEAR Components is by using one of the online tools. They are great to take your first steps, while they help to find other developers and components in the NEAR ecosystem.

#### [NEAR Sandbox](https://near.org/sandbox)
The [near website](https://near.org/) contains its own [sandbox editor](https://near.org/sandbox). You can simply start coding and preview your components in the browser. 

The sandbox also allows you to easily deploy your components to the NEAR blockchain and share them with others.

#### [NEAR Social](https://near.social)
[NEAR Social](https://near.social) was the first social network built on NEAR. It allows you to create and share NEAR Components with others. You can also use it to interact with other developers and components in the NEAR ecosystem.

#### [Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai)
[Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai) is a web IDE made for NEAR developers. It contains examples and tutorials to help onboarding you.

## Local Tools

If you want to collaborate with a team or work on a larger project, you will likely want more version control, automated testing, deployment, and other workflows.

For this, the NEAR ecosystem offers a myriad of tools that adapt to your way of working to supercharge your local project development.

These tools allows to easily develop and test your components entirely locally, without needing to deploy a contract to the chain in order to test them within other components.

#### [NEAR VSCode Extension](vscode.md)
The [NEAR VSCode Extension](vscode.md) integrates with the VSCode IDE to help you develop, preview and deploy components all within VSCode.

#### [BOS Loader](bos-loader.md)
A CLI tool to preview local components in NEAR BOS. A perfect companion to the [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs).

#### [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs)
A command line utility that simplifies local component development for NEAR BOS.

#### [Collaborative Repository Template](https://github.com/near-examples/bos-components)
A repository template that enables multiple people to collaborate on NEAR components by automatically deploying the components to the chain when somebody push code to the `main` branch.
