title: Choose your Dev Environment
---

The environments in which you can develop `Components` are divided into two categories:

- [Web Tools](#web-tools): Online tools that allow you to quickly start building and sharing components.
- [Local Tools](#local-tools): Tools that allow you to develop and test components locally.

:::tip Handling collaborations
If you plan to collaborate with multiple people, we recommend you to check [this repository template](https://github.com/near-examples/bos-components) which automatically deploys components each time a PR is merged.

## Web Tools
The quickest way to start building NEAR Components is by using one of the online tools. They are great for taking your first steps, while they let you find other developers and components in the NEAR ecosystem.

#### [NEAR Sandbox](https://near.org/sandbox)
The [near website](https://near.org/) contains its own [sandbox editor](https://near.org/sandbox). The sandbox allows you to code, preview and deploy your components directly from your browser.

#### [Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai)
[Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai) is a web IDE made for NEAR developers. It contains examples and tutorials to help onboarding you.

## Local Tools

If you want to collaborate with a team or work on a larger project, you will likely want more **version control**, automated testing and deployment, and other workflows. For this, the NEAR ecosystem offers a set of tools to easily develop and test your components entirely locally.

#### [NEAR VSCode Extension](vscode.md)
The [NEAR VSCode Extension](vscode.md) integrates with the VSCode IDE to help you develop, preview and deploy components all within VSCode.

#### [BOS Loader](bos-loader.md)
A CLI tool to preview local components in NEAR BOS. A perfect companion to the [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs).

#### [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs)
A command line utility that simplifies local component development for NEAR BOS.
