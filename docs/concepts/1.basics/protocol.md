NEAR Protocol (“NEAR” hereafter) is a public blockchain built from the ground up to be user-focused, secure and amazingly fast. Specifically, NEAR is designed to:

1. **Onboard** users with a smooth experience, even if they have never used crypto, tokens, wallets, or other blockchain artifacts.
2. **Build** decentralized applications with ease, specially for web developers that have never developed a smart contract before.
3. **Scale** applications seamlessly - transfers are instantaneous and have almost zero cost. The underlying platform automatically scales applications without additional costs or effort on the developer’s side.
4. **Be Green**. NEAR works using something called proof-of-stake which is highly efficient in terms of energy. NEAR consumes in a year what bitcoin consumes in [3 minutes](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/how-near-went-carbon-neutral-e656db96da47#:~:text=The%20firm%20found%20that%20NEAR,PoS%20technology%20instead%20of%20PoW).

## What is a blockchain? {#why-are-we-building-near}
You may have heard of distributed computing, databases, or computer networks, all of which play a role in blockchains.

Currently, most web-services utilize a single server and a single database to process your request and provide information. This infrastructure is usually managed by an individual entity who treats all of their data processing like a black box: the request goes in, something happens, and the user receives an output.

While the company may rely on third parties to verify those claims, the user will never be able to verify what happened in the black box. This system relies on trust between users and companies.

NEAR is similar in principle to the “cloud-based” infrastructure that developers currently build applications on top of, except that the cloud is no longer controlled by a single company running a giant data center — that data center is actually made up of all the people around the world who are operating nodes on the decentralized network. Instead of a “company-operated cloud,” it's a “community-operated cloud.”

To set the stage, we’re building a “base-layer blockchain,” or a layer-one, meaning that it’s on the same level of the ecosystem as projects like Ethereum or Cosmos. That means everything in the ecosystem is built on top of the NEAR blockchain, including your application.

## What can we do we a blockchain?
There are two main actions that any user can perform in the NEAR ecosystem: transferring money and interacting with decentralized applications.

**Transferring money**: Transferring money refers to sending NEARs from one user to another using the NEAR WALLET. Transfers in NEAR are instantaneous and have a negligible cost.

**Executing decentralized applications**: Besides transferring money, NEAR tokens can be used to execute decentralized applications, aka smart contracts. Smart contracts are small programs that live in the blockchain.

## Who secures the blockchain?
NEAR Protocol is a proof-of-stake network which means that Sybil resistance from various attacks is done by staking Ⓝ. Staked Ⓝ represent a “medallion” for service providers that supply a decentralized infrastructure of servers that are maintaining state and processing transactions to NEAR users and applications. In exchange for this service, node providers receive rewards in Ⓝ.
