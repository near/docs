An epoch is a unit of time during which validators of the network remain constant.

Epoch length is set at network genesis and can be discovered by calling the `genesis_config` RPC method as follows:

```text
http post https://rpc.testnet.near.org jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=EXPERIMENTAL_genesis_config
```

Testnet has the duration of an epoch (`epoch_length`) set to `43200` seconds or about ~12 hours.


```json

  "avg_hidden_validator_seats_per_shard": [
    0
  ],

  "chunk_producer_kickout_threshold": 90,

```
