> NEAR Indexer is a library included with [nearcore](https://github.com/near/nearcore) that allows you to run a node on the network which listens for targeted information on the blockchain. The [NEAR Indexer Framework](/docs/tools/near-indexer-framework) provides the logic of polling a node for blocks produced in a network then aggregating and streaming these blocks to a listener.

To better understand this, blockchain data is optimized for serialized writes, one block at a time, as the chain is being created. Querying the blockchain for data about a specific block or account is a fairly straightforward or "narrow" query. However, querying data across many blocks can be cumbersome because we have to aggregate results from multiple single-block queries. We can consider these "wide" queries.

- An indexer listens to the stream of data as it's being written on chain and can then be immediately filtered and processed to detect interesting events or patterns.
- This stream of data can then be written to a permanent database for later data analysis using a convenient query language like SQL.

- One example that highlights the need for a "wide query" is when you use a seed phrase to recover one or more accounts. Since a seed phrase essentially represents a signing key pair, the recovery is for **all** accounts that share the associated public key. Therefore, when a seed phrase is used to recover an account via [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/), the query requires that **all accounts** with a matching public key are found and recovered.

- The easiest way to achieve a "wide query" is to utilize a database that has been filled by an indexing service. For this purpose weâ€™ve built the [NEAR Indexer for wallet](https://github.com/near/near-indexer-for-wallet) which listens to all actions on chain that might create or delete [access keys](/docs/concepts/account#access-keys) and stores them into a relational database for easier querying of accounts.
