import { Faucet } from '@site/src/components/faucet';

A **faucet** provides free `testnet` tokens for testing and development purposes.

There are two testnet faucets: the builtâ€‘in faucet on this page - which provides native `testnet` NEAR only - and the [Testnet Faucet](#testnet-near-faucet), which supports many fungible tokens (NEAR, USDT, and more).

:::info

If any of the faucets is not working, please report it on our [NEAR Telegram Channel](https://t.me/neardev)

## Faucet

Simply introduce the account you want to receive the tokens in, and click on the "Request" button. The faucet will send a small amount of `testnet` NEAR tokens to that account.

## [Testnet NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)

Navigate to the [Testnet Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/) page, input your address and select which type of token you need! The faucet supports a wide range of fungible tokens, including NEAR, Tether USD, Ether, and many others.

Please know that the faucet might be out of tokens at times, keep reading below for alternative ways to get other fungible tokens

## Getting Fungible Tokens

Another way to get fungible tokens on `testnet` is through the [`testnet` version of ref finance](https://testnet.ref.finance/#near|ref.fakes.testnet)

There, you can swap `testnet` NEAR for other fungible tokens, such as `testnet USDC`, `testnet USDT`, `testnet DAI`, and others

:::info Fungible Tokens on Ref Finance

Please notice that tokens on `testnet` might not hold the same rate as on `mainnet` (e.g. `1 USDC` might not exchange to the same amount of `NEAR` as on `mainnet`), furthermore, liquidity on `testnet` might be very low
