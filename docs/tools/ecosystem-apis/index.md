If you are building a decentralized applications, chances are that you will need to query on-chain data. Since building a full indexer is not always feasible, the community has created a set of APIs that you can use to query data from the NEAR blockchain.

These APIs provide a simple way to access on-chain data without having to run your own indexer or node. They are designed to be easy to use and provide a wide range of functionality, from querying account balances to exploring transactions and blocks.
