While websites serve both human readers and LLMs, LLMs benefit from concise information gathered in a single, accessible location. This is critical for use cases like development environments, where LLMs need quick access to programming documentation and APIs.

NEAR Docs hosts a [`llms.txt`](https://docs.near.org/llms.txt) file to provide information to help LLMs use the complete NEAR documentation at inference time.
