> NEAR Explorer allows you to view block creations in real time! This useful tool allows you to search for [transactions](/docs/concepts/transaction) and [accounts](/docs/concepts/account) allowing you to view all interactions between users and smart contracts.

NEAR has several [development networks](/docs/concepts/networks) operating independently of each other with their own account IDs. Because of this, there are several deployed wallets you can use.

* [NEAR Explorer `mainnet`](https://explorer.near.org)
* [NEAR Explorer `testnet`](https://explorer.testnet.near.org)
* [NEAR Explorer `betanet`](https://explorer.betanet.near.org)

To deploy your own version of NEAR Explorer or to make contributions, please visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/near/near-explorer).
