import { Faucet } from '@site/src/components/faucet';

A **faucet** provides free `testnet` tokens for testing and development purposes.

There are two testnet faucets: the built‑in faucet on this page - which provides native `testnet` NEAR only - and the [Testnet Faucet](#external-faucets), which supports many fungible tokens (NEAR, USDT, and more).

:::warning The faucets are not working?

If any of the faucets is not working, please report it on our [NEAR Telegram Channel](https://t.me/neardev) or open an issue in our [NEAR GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/docs/issues).

## Faucet

Simply introduce the account you want to receive the tokens in, and click on the "Request" button. The faucet will send a small amount of `testnet` NEAR tokens to that account.

## [Testnet NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)

Navigate to the [Testnet Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/) page, input your address and select which type of token you need! The faucet supports a wide range of fungible tokens, including NEAR, Tether USD, Ether, and many others.

:::info Supported tokens

Please know that the faucet might be out of tokens at times, keep reading below for alternative ways to get other fungible tokens

## Getting Fungible Tokens

Another way to get fungible tokens on `testnet` is through the [`testnet` version of ref finance](https://testnet.ref.finance/#near|ref.fakes.testnet)

There, you can swap `testnet` NEAR for other fungible tokens, such as `testnet USDC`, `testnet USDT`, `testnet DAI`, and others

:::info Fungible Tokens on Ref Finance

Please notice that tokens on `testnet` might not hold the same rate as on `mainnet` (e.g. `1 USDC` might not exchange to the same amount of `NEAR` as on `mainnet`), furthermore, liquidity on `testnet` might be very low
