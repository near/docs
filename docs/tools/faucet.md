In the NEAR ecosystem, a **faucet** is a service that provides free tokens to developers and users for testing and development purposes. This is particularly useful for those working on the NEAR testnet, where real tokens are not required but access to tokens is necessary for testing smart contracts and applications.

There are currently two testnet faucets:

- [Developer Portal Faucet](https://dev.near.org/faucet)
- [Testnet NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)

:::info Supported tokens

The [Developer Portal Faucet](https://dev.near.org/faucet) provides only `testnet` native tokens, while the [Testnet Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/) supports a wide range of fungible tokens, including NEAR, Tether USD, USD Coin, Ether, and many others.

:::warning The faucets are not working?

If any of the faucets is not working, please report it on our [NEAR Telegram Channel](https://t.me/neardev) or open an issue in our [NEAR GitHub repository](https://github.com/near/docs/issues).

## Getting Testnet tokens

If you have a NEAR `testnet` account and need tokens to experiment, test, and build on the NEAR blockchain, follow these simple steps to get free tokens:

1. Open the [Developer Portal Faucet](https://dev.near.org/faucet) or [Testnet Faucet website](https://near-faucet.io/)

![Faucet](/docs/assets/tools/faucet.png)
*Main page of [Testnet Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)*

2. Fill out the information:
   - Desired token (`NEAR` by default)
   - Wallet address (e.g., `myaccount.testnet`)
   - Amount
3. Click `Request` and receive your Tokens
   - The faucet will provide a link with the token transaction.

## Getting Fungible Tokens

Another way to get fungible tokens on `testnet` is through the [`testnet` version of ref finance](https://testnet.ref.finance/#near|ref.fakes.testnet)

There, you can swap `testnet` NEAR for other fungible tokens, such as `testnet USDC`, `testnet USDT`, `testnet DAI`, and others

:::info Fungible Tokens on Ref Finance

Please notice that tokens on `testnet` might not hold the same rate as on `mainnet` (e.g. `1 USDC` might not exchange to the same amount of `NEAR` as on `mainnet`), furthermore, liquidity on `testnet` might be very low
