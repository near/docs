> NEAR Wallet is an in-browser, web-based wallet for creating and interacting with NEAR accounts. This wallet stores account keys in the browser's `localStorage`.

NEAR has several [development networks](https://docs.near.org/docs/roles/developer/networks) operating independently of each other with their own account IDs. Because of this, there are several deployed wallets you can use.

* [NEAR Wallet `mainnet`](https://wallet.near.org)
* [NEAR Wallet `testnet`](https://wallet.testnet.near.org)
* [NEAR Wallet `betanet`](https://wallet.betanet.near.org)

To deploy your own version of NEAR Wallet or to make contributions, please visit our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/near/near-wallet).
