We have integrated with the Optimism OP stack. Utilizing the `Batcher` for submissions to NEAR and the `proposer` for submitting NEAR commitment data to Ethereum.

The folder [`./op-stack`](https://github.com/near/rollup-data-availability/tree/main/op-stack) in our repo contains a few projects:

- `optimism`: Sequencer, Batcher, Proposer, etc. This is the rollup node.
- `da-rpc-go`: Formerly `da-rpc`. This is the go package for integrating with `da-rpc-sys`.
