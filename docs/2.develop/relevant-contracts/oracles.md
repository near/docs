Oracles are smart contracts that enable you to query the current price of an asset. Since smart contracts cannot connect to
internet and pull information, Oracles rely on having someone constantly updating their prices. Because of that, be mindful
when using an oracle that there might be a delay between the market's latest information and the Oracles data.

In contrast with [FT](ft.md) and [NFT](nft.md), Oracle contract's are not standardized. We will here list different providers
and how to use their Oracle as they are built.
