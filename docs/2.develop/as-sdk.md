title: 🚀 AssemblyScript SDK
---

[AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) is a dialect of TypeScript programming language that compiles to WebAssembly. The syntax resembles JavaScript, but with strict and static typing. One can think of it as a mix of TypeScript's high level syntax and C's low-level capabilities. Thanks to this, the resulting WebAssembly modules can profit from predictable performance while guaranteeing a small binary size. However, this comes with the tradeoff of having to strictly type all variables and structures, and therefore not having `any`, `union` types or `undefined` variables.

:::caution
Because of its maturity and safety features, we strongly recommend to use Rust when writing financial contracts.
