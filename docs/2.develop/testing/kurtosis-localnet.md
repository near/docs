description: Using Kurtosis NEAR Package to develop locally
---

> [Kurtosis](https://www.kurtosis.com/) has created an easy way to spin up a local NEAR testing environment using a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/). 

This Kurtosis NEAR Package contains the following components:

- [Indexer for Explorer](https://github.com/near/near-indexer-for-explorer)
- [NEAR Explorer](https://github.com/near/near-explorer)
- [NEAR Wallet](https://github.com/near/near-wallet)
- Local RPC Endpoint

[Visit here](https://www.loom.com/share/8a1b8e2138334a81a380f5d523fba27e) to see a short demo of the package in action.

---

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
- [NEAR-CLI](/tools/near-cli#setup)
- [Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install)
  - Start Kurtosis engine after installation using: `kurtosis engine start`

---

## Setup

### Launch Kurtosis NEAR Package {#launching-cluster}

Launch your Kurtosis NEAR Package in four easy steps!

1) Launch [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2) Copy the [Kurtosis NEAR Package launch script](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/near-package/blob/master/launch-local-near-cluster.sh) by running the following:

```bash
curl -o ~/launch-local-near-cluster.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kurtosis-tech/near-package/master/launch-local-near-cluster.sh -L
```

3) Grant write permission to the script file you just downloaded:

```bash
chmod u+x ~/launch-local-near-cluster.sh
```

4) Launch the Kurtosis NEAR Package:

If you're running the NEAR-in-Kurtosis cluster on your local machine:
```bash
~/launch-local-near-cluster.sh
```

If you're running your NEAR-in-Kurtosis cluster on a machine you intend to access remotely, replace `1.2.3.4` with the IP address of the machine you're running the cluster on:
```bash
~/launch-local-near-cluster.sh '{"backend_ip_address":"1.2.3.4"}'
```

:::tip

The URLs and validator key value above will be the same for each run of Kurtosis, so you can safely use these values in your config files.

:::

:::tip

If you're running Kurtosis on a remote machine, you'll also need to:

- Replace the `127.0.0.1` IP addresses in the environment variables with the IP address of your remote machine
- Copy the validator key from where it lives on the machine running Kurtosis (in `NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_KEY_PATH`) to somewhere on your local machine
- Adjust the value of the `NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_KEY_PATH` on your local machine to match the location you stored the key at

:::


</p>
</details>

If you ever forget the above URLs, you can inspect the cluster:

```
kurtosis enclave inspect near
```

### Setup Environment Variables

After deploying your Kurtosis NEAR Package, you will need to setup some environment variables to make life a lot easier. Notice the **ACTION** sections in your terminal log from the package deployment. You will be using these exact values to setup these variables. 

1) Follow the first ACTION item from the deployment log by copying all of the export commands and running them in your terminal.

**Example exports: (DO NOT COPY ~ yours will be slightly different)**

```bash
export NEAR_ENV="local"
export NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_NETWORK_ID="localnet"
export NEAR_NODE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8332"
export NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_KEY_PATH="/Users/zerix/.neartosis/2022-06-03T18.04.32/validator-key.json"
export NEAR_WALLET_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8334"
export NEAR_HELPER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8330"
export NEAR_HELPER_ACCOUNT="test.near"
export NEAR_EXPLORER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8331"
```

2) Proceed to the second ACTION item which asks you to create an alias for `local_near`. This is what we will use when running [`near-cli`](/tools/near-cli) commands with our test environment. 

**Example alias: (DO NOT COPY ~ yours will be slightly different)**

```bash
alias local_near='NEAR_ENV="local" NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_NETWORK_ID="localnet" NEAR_NODE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8332" NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_KEY_PATH="/Users/zerix/.neartosis/2022-06-03T18.04.32/validator-key.json" NEAR_WALLET_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8334" NEAR_HELPER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8330" NEAR_HELPER_ACCOUNT="test.near" NEAR_EXPLORER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8331" near'
```

Now replacing `near` with `local_near` when running [`near-cli`](/tools/near-cli) commands will perform these actions in your local test environment.

### Testing

Ensure that your alias is working correctly by checking the state of the root account `test.near`.

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
local_near state test.near
```

This should return something similar to the following output:

```bash
Loaded master account test.near key from /Users/zerix/.neartosis/2022-06-03T18.04.32/validator-key.json with public key = ed25519:3Kuyi2DUXdoHgoaNEvCxa1m6G8xqc6Xs7WGajaqLhNmW
Account test.near
{
  amount: '1000000000000000000000000000000000',
  block_hash: 'G8jx4pYgqFSFSCDyM9MvVYj3HAdgRuxhkAHGweNhUNrY',
  block_height: 224,
  code_hash: '11111111111111111111111111111111',

  storage_paid_at: 0,
  storage_usage: 182,
  formattedAmount: '1,000,000,000'
}
```

**Congratulations! Setup is complete and you are ready to start exploring your local NEAR blockchain!** 🎉

:::tip

The Kurtosis Team has created a great [video presentation](https://www.loom.com/share/8a1b8e2138334a81a380f5d523fba27e) that covers the above steps as well as demoing the functionality of this local network setup.

## Using Wallet and Explorer

### Local NEAR Wallet

Now that you have [everything setup](#setup), create an account using [your local NEAR Wallet at http://127.0.0.1:8334](http://127.0.0.1:8334).

![Local wallet landing page](/docs/assets/kurtosis/local-wallet-landing-page.png)

The account creation is exactly the same as on mainnet or testnet but **only the passphrase recovery mode** will work here. Also note that the root account is `test.near` instead of `testnet` or `mainnet`. This means that all the accounts you create will be [subaccounts](/concepts/basics/accounts/model#subaccounts) of `test.near`. (ex. `benji.test.near`)

:::tip

Because the Wallet will start on the same host and port, and the Wallet stores your account information in your browser's local storage, if you've created an account with a previous Kurtosis network then the Wallet will be storing the old account's information (which won't work with your new network). If this is the case for you, you'll need to clear the Wallet's storage by visiting [your Chrome's local storage](chrome://settings/siteData?searchSubpage=127.0.0.1), removing the `127.0.0.1` entry, and refreshing the Wallet.

:::

Now that you've created an account, try interacting with it using the local CLI. In order to use this account you will need to "login" with it via CLI which will save a full access key locally for that account. [`near login`](/tools/near-cli#near-login) is the command to perform this action but as you are on `localnet` you will need to replace `near` with `local_near`.

```bash
local_near login
```

This launches the local wallet site and will ask for confirmation for this action. Once you authorize you should see confirmation in your terminal similar to this:

```bash
Logged in as [ kevin.test.near ] with public key [ ed25519:8EaALn... ] successfully
```

- Export your account ID to an environment variable by running the following: (replacing YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID)

```bash
export ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```

- Now create a test transaction by sending 1 $NEAR to the root account `test.near`:

```bash
local_near send $ACCOUNT_ID test.near 1
```

<summary>Example response: </summary>

```

</p>
</details>

### Local NEAR Explorer

Again, now that you have [everything setup](#setup) you can view the transaction details of the command you just performed at the end of [the last section](#local-near-wallet). Notice that the last line of the terminal log displays a link to the transaction details in your local NEAR Explorer.

```bash
Sending 1 NEAR to test.near from kevin.test.near
Loaded master account test.near key from /Users/zerix/.neartosis/2022-06-03T18.04.32/validator-key.json with public key = ed25519:3Kuyi2DUXdoHgoaNEvCxa1m6G8xqc6Xs7WGajaqLhNmW
Transaction Id 3e3H5zqj9noKGYTCMqeZ5pb4NWK7tQsjYKak6ybtpgvD

```

- Click on this link or copy/paste it into your browser:

![Local explorer sending 1 NEAR](/docs/assets/kurtosis/local-explorer-send-funds.png)

Here everything behaves exactly like the `testnet` or `mainnet` NEAR Explorer except it is retrieving data from your local NEAR blockchain!

- If you ever need to open your local NEAR Explorer, you can [always visit 127.0.0.1:8331](http://127.0.0.1:8331/) or run:


```bash
echo $NEAR_EXPLORER_URL
```

**Example Response:**

```bash

## Deploy a Smart Contract

With everything setup and your `test.near` account created, it's time to deploy a smart contract on `localnet`. For this example you will deploy an NFT use a pre-compiled WASM smart contract from [this NFT example](https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial.git).

- Download the smart contract:

```
curl -o ~/main.wasm https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/raw/main/out/main.wasm -L
```

- Deploy the smart contract:

```
local_near deploy --wasmFile ~/main.wasm --accountId $ACCOUNT_ID
```

```

</p>
</details>

- Click on the clink to the Explorer and verify that the contract was deployed:

![Local explorer contract deployed](/docs/assets/kurtosis/local-explorer-contract-deployed.png)

Now, let's interact with the deployed contract.

- First, initialize the contract by running the following command: 

```bash
local_near call $ACCOUNT_ID new_default_meta '{"owner_id": "'$ACCOUNT_ID'"}' --accountId $ACCOUNT_ID
```

This will initialize the contract with some default metadata and set our account ID as the owner of the contract.

- Now mint your first NFT!

```bash
local_near call $ACCOUNT_ID nft_mint '{"token_id": "team_token", "metadata": { "title": "Go Team!", "description": "Go Team!", "media": "https://bafybeiftczwrtyr3k7a2k4vutd3amkwsmaqyhrdzlhvpt33dyjivufqusq.ipfs.dweb.link/goteam-gif.gif", "copies": 1}, "receiver_id": "'$ACCOUNT_ID'"}' --accountId $ACCOUNT_ID --amount 0.1
```

Once the NFT has been minted, you can view the token on the local wallet's collectibles tab. If you already had the wallet site open, simply refresh. Otherwise open your local NEAR Wallet instance and view your collectible.

We won't spoil what the NFT is, but once you switch over to the collectibles tab your beautiful token should be there!

## Connecting a dApp to `localnet`

The ability to develop decentralized applications locally is a dream come true for dApp developers and the Kurtosis NEAR Package really simplifies this process. Here you'll integrate `localnet` into one of the examples at [near.dev](http://near.dev).

### Clone Example dApp

- Clone the [NEAR Guestbook](https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book-js) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book-js.git
```

### Configure Network

- Open the `src/config.js` file inside the guestbook repo and scroll down to the `local` config:

```javascript
case 'local':
      return {
        networkId: 'local',
        nodeUrl: 'http://localhost:3030',
        keyPath: `${process.env.HOME}/.near/validator_key.json`,
        walletUrl: 'http://localhost:4000/wallet',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME
      };
```

Here you will need to update all of the values **except** the `contractName`. Copy the following into your `local` case. This will automatically assign the config to your environment variables if you've specified them. This way, you don't need to change anything when running new enclaves.

```javascript
case 'local':
      return {
            networkId: process.env.NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_NETWORK_ID || 'local',
            nodeUrl: process.env.NEAR_NODE_URL || 'http://localhost:3030',
            keyPath: process.env.NEAR_CLI_LOCALNET_KEY_PATH || `${process.env.HOME}/.near/validator_key.json`,
            walletUrl: process.env.NEAR_WALLET_URL || 'http://localhost:4000/wallet',
            contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
        };
```

The last thing you will need to do is set your `NODE_ENV` in your terminal to `local` so your dApp will use the values we configured above.

- Run:

```bash
export NODE_ENV=local
```

**Your dApp is now fully configured to use `localnet`!** 🎉

### Create Contract Account

As mentioned earlier, you do not need to change the `contractName` in the `config.js` file you updated earlier. This is an environment variable you will configure now. Let's quickly create a subaccount from [the account you created earlier](#local-near-wallet) to deploy the guest-book contract to.

- Using the `local_near CLI`, run the following command:

```bash
local_near create-account guest-book.$ACCOUNT_ID --masterAccount $ACCOUNT_ID --initialBalance 5
```

**Example Response:**

```bash
Loaded master account test.near key from /Users/benjaminkurrek/.neartosis/2021-12-02T13.37.41/validator-key.json with public key = ed25519:AnLHi4ZAxfxFAQSXniycyZS6dpBqxhmVZH3zBCZbqAS6
Saving key to 'undefined/localnet/guest-book.goteam.test.near.json'
Account guest-book.goteam.test.near for network "localnet" was created.
```

- Export the `CONTRACT_NAME` environment variable as the account you just created:

```bash
export CONTRACT_NAME=guest-book.$ACCOUNT_ID
```

### Deploy Contract to `localnet`

With the network setup and contract account created you are now ready to launch your dApp! 

- Run the following command in the root directory of the guest book repo:

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

**Example Response:**

![Local dApp build](/docs/assets/kurtosis/local-dapp-build.png)

- Open the dApp by clicking on the server address in the terminal:

```bash
Server running at http://localhost:1234
✨  Built in 1.20s.
```

You should see the Guest Book landing page:

![Local Guest Book Landing Page](/docs/assets/kurtosis/local-guest-book-landing.png)

:::tip

 If you run into any problems signing into try clearing your browser's local storage. If you've used the guest-book before your browser might think you're still logged in with your `testnet` account and it will throw an error saying it can't find that account on `localnet`.

:::

Once you've logged in, you can sign a message with an optional donation. 

![Local Guest Book Signed Message](/docs/assets/kurtosis/local-guest-book-signed-message.png)

- Sign the Guest Book which will create a transaction on `localnet`. 

- Once complete, open your local NEAR explorer and you can view the transaction you just created!

**Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and interacted with a dApp on a local NEAR blockchain!** 🎉

## Managing NEAR Pacakages

The Kurtosis NEAR Pacakages you create will continue to run on your local machine for as long as your Docker engine is running. This package runs inside of a Kurtosis "enclave" which is an environment isolated from both your computer and other enclaves. In practice, this means that you can have multiple independent local NEAR clusters running on your machine simply by rerunning the script we executed from the [setup instructions](#setup).


### View Package Status

- To see the status of your existing enclaves, run:

```bash
kurtosis enclave ls
```

### View Package Details

- To see detailed information about an enclave, copy an enclave ID and run:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect near
```

### Terminate Package

- To shut down your NEAR Package and free up resources on your machine, run the following:

```bash
kurtosis enclave stop near
```

:::note

You will not be able to restart the cluster! If this is something you need, please [file an issue here](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis-cli-release-artifacts) so we can prioritize it.

:::

### Delete Package

- Stopping an enclave leaves its resources intact so that you can examine them if need be. To destroy a stopped enclave and free its resources, run:

```
kurtosis clean
```

### Delete All Package

If you would like to destroy _all_ enclaves, regardless of if they're running, pass the `-a` flag to `clean` like so:

```
kurtosis clean -a
```

This can be a handy way to clear all your Kurtosis data.
