Welcome! If you are thinking about developing a smartcontract in the NEAR blockchain you have come to the right place. This page will guide you through all the steps needed, from developing to testing and deploying a contract. Even if you are a more advance user, you can still find important information such as how to perform unit and integration testing, as well as how to securely perform cross-contract comunications.

Smartcontracts in the NEAR ecosystem are writen in either Assemblyscript or Rust. While it is not necessary to be an expert in either language, we will assume you have a basic knowledge of at least one of them. If you never used any of them we recommend you to start [here with Rust](broken) and [here with assemblyscript](broken). Remember, you donâ€™t need to be an expert, you just need to understand enough to be able to follow the code examples. More over, do not worry if you have no previous knowledge on what a blockchain or a smart contract is, we will guide you through all the necessary concepts.

Are you searching for a different type of documentation?. Information on how to interact with a smart contract and integrate it into your app is [available here](broken). An overview of the NEAR platform and how it works [be found here](broken), while its RUST implementation is in [nomicon.io](nomicon.io).

If while reading this page you have any questions, please feel free to join our community on [Discord](http://near.chat/) and reach out! We are here to help.


### Searching for the SDK?
If you are an advanced user searching for the SDK they can be found here:

- [near-sdk-rs](broken): The SDK used in the RUST language
- [near-sdk-as](broken): The SDK used in the Assemblyscript language
