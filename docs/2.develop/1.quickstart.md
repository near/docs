## Prerequisites
In order to successfully follow this quickstart guide you will need the following software

### 🌐 Node.js
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, install `yarn`: `npm install --global yarn`.

### 🦀 Rust and Wasm

Follow [these instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for setting up Rust. Then, add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain which enables compiling Rust to [Web Assembly (wasm)](https://webassembly.org/), the low-level language used by the NEAR platform.

#### Linux and MacOS:

```bash
# Get rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Add the wasm toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Your First Contract: Hello NEAR!

Lets create your first decentralized app using NEAR, for this you will need just one command.
Using [npm's npx](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner):

    npx create-near-app [options] hello-near

**or**, if you prefer [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/create/):

    yarn create near-app [options] hello-near

Without any options, this will create a project with a **vanilla JavaScript** frontend and an AssemblyScript smart contract. If you prefer, you can create a **React** frontend or a **Rust** smart contract you can use these options:

* `--frontend=react` – use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for your frontend template
* `--contract=rust` – use [Rust](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/rust/near-sdk-rs) for your smart contract

---

## Interacting With the Contract

Once `create near app` finishes creating the `hello-near` app it is time for you to try it!. Enter the directory and use `yarn` to start it. If you are in Linux or MacOS you can do so with the commands:

```bash
cd hello-near
yarn start
```

You will see the command line will start to output a series of messages, this is because many things are happening in the background. Particularly, your contract is being **compiled** and **deployed** to the `testnet` network, and the frontend is being built. You will see an output similar to the following one, and then the website will pop (if it doesn't open: ).:

```bash
> new-awesome-project@0.0.1 build:contract:debug
> node contract/compile.js --debug

> greeter@0.0.1 build:debug
> asb --target debug

> new-awesome-project@0.0.1 dev:deploy:contract
> near dev-deploy

Starting deployment. Account id: dev-1647957252424-69485909873285, node: https://rpc.testnet.near.org, helper: https://helper.testnet.near.org, file: ./out/main.wasm
