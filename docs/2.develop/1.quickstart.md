In this quickstart tutorial we will take you through all the necesary steps to create your first decentralized application (dApp) in the NEAR platform. Particularly, you will create a hello world app and interact with it through a simple front end.

---

## ‚ö° Prerequisites
In order to successfully follow this quickstart guide you will need Node.js and RUST.

### üöÄ Node.js
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, install `yarn`: `npm install --global yarn`.

### ü¶Ä Rust and Wasm

Follow [these instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for setting up Rust. Then, add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain which enables compiling Rust to [Web Assembly (wasm)](https://webassembly.org/), the low-level language used by the NEAR platform.

#### Linux and MacOS:

```bash
# Get rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Add the wasm toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## üëã Hello NEAR!

Lets create your first decentralized app using NEAR, for this you will need just one command.
Using [npm's npx](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner):

    npx create-near-app [options] hello-near

**or**, if you prefer [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/create/):

    yarn create near-app [options] hello-near

Without any options, this will create a project with a **vanilla JavaScript** frontend and an AssemblyScript smart contract. If you prefer, you can create a **React** frontend or a **Rust** smart contract you can use these options:

* `--frontend=react` ‚Äì use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for your frontend template
* `--contract=rust` ‚Äì use [Rust](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/rust/near-sdk-rs) for your smart contract

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Interacting With your dApp

Before we talk about the structure in the folder structure of your dApp, go ahead and try it!. For this, 
enter the directory and use `yarn` to start it.

```bash
cd hello-near
yarn dev
```

Your contract will then be **compiled** and **deployed** to an **account** in the `testnet` network. When done, a browser window should open with your dApp. Go ahead, sign in and play around a bit, once you get familiarized with the application come back.

## üìÇ Structure of your dApp

Let's take a closer look to the structure of your dApp. Within the `hello-near` folder you should have the following structure:

- `./contract`: Contains the smart contract code
- `./neardev`: Contains the keys to the contrac's account
- `./out`: The compiled smart contract in `.wasm`
- `./src`: The frontend is here
- `package.json`: The configuration of node.js
