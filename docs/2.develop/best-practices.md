# Best practices

## Enable overflow checks

It's usually helpful to panic on integer overflow. To enable it, add the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[profile.release]
overflow-checks = true
```

## Use `require!` early

Try to validate the input, context, state and access using `require!` before taking any actions. The earlier you panic, the more [gas](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/transactions/gas) you will save for the caller.

```rust
#[near_bindgen]
impl Contract {
    pub fn set_fee(&mut self, new_fee: Fee) {
        require!(env::predecessor_account_id() == self.owner_id, "Owner's method");
        new_fee.assert_valid();
        self.internal_set_fee(new_fee);
    }
}
```

**Note**: If you want debug information in the panic message or if you are using an SDK version before `4.0.0-pre.2`, 
the Rust `assert!` macro can be used instead of `require!`.

```rust
#[near_bindgen]
impl Contract {
    pub fn set_fee(&mut self, new_fee: Fee) {
        assert_eq!(env::predecessor_account_id(), self.owner_id, "Owner's method");
        new_fee.assert_valid();
        self.internal_set_fee(new_fee);
    }
}
```

## Use `log!`

Use logging for debugging and notifying user.

When you need a formatted message, you can use the following macro:

```rust
log!("Transferred {} tokens from {} to {}", amount, sender_id, receiver_id);
```

It's equivalent to the following message:

```rust
env::log_str(format!("Transferred {} tokens from {} to {}", amount, sender_id, receiver_id).as_ref());
```

## Return `Promise`

If your method makes a cross-contract call, you probably want to return the newly created `Promise`.
This allows the caller (such as a near-cli or near-api-js call) to wait for the result of the promise instead of returning immediately.
Additionally, if the promise fails for some reason, returning it will let the caller know about the failure, as well as enabling NEAR Explorer and other tools to mark the whole transaction chain as failing.
This can prevent false-positives when the first or first few transactions in a chain succeed but a subsequent transaction fails.

E.g.

```rust
#[near_bindgen]
impl Contract {
    pub fn withdraw_100(&mut self, receiver_id: AccountId) -> Promise {
        Promise::new(receiver_id).transfer(100)
    }
}
```

## Reuse crates from `near-sdk`

`near-sdk` re-exports the following crates:

- `borsh`
- `base64`
- `bs58`
- `serde`
- `serde_json`

Most common crates include `borsh` which is needed for internal STATE serialization and
`serde` for external JSON serialization.

When marking structs with `serde::Serialize` you need to use `#[serde(crate = "near_sdk::serde")]`
to point serde to the correct base crate.

```rust
/// Import `borsh` from `near_sdk` crate 
use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
/// Import `serde` from `near_sdk` crate 
use near_sdk::serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

/// Main contract structure serialized with Borsh
#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize, PanicOnDefault)]
pub struct Contract {
    pub pair: Pair,
}

/// Implements both `serde` and `borsh` serialization.
/// `serde` is typically useful when returning a struct in JSON format for a frontend.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
#[serde(crate = "near_sdk::serde")]
pub struct Pair {
    pub a: u32,
    pub b: u32,
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl Contract {
    #[init]
    pub fn new(pair: Pair) -> Self {
        Self {
            pair,
        }
    }

    pub fn get_pair(self) -> Pair {
        self.pair
    }
}
```

## `std::panic!` vs `env::panic`

- `std::panic!` panics the current thread. It uses `format!` internally, so it can take arguments.
  SDK sets up a panic hook, which converts the generated `PanicInfo` from `panic!` into a string and uses `env::panic` internally to report it to Runtime.
  This may provide extra debugging information such as the line number of the source code where the panic happened.

- `env::panic` directly calls the host method to panic the contract.
  It doesn't provide any other extra debugging information except for the passed message.

## Use workspaces

Workspaces allow you to automate workflows and run tests for multiple contracts and cross-contract calls in a sandbox or testnet environment.
