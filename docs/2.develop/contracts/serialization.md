title: Notes on Serialization
---

Smart contracts need to be able to **communicate complex data** in a simple way, while
also **reading and storing** such data into their states efficiently.

To achieve such simple communication and efficient storage, smart contracts morph the data
from their complex representation into simpler ones.

This process of translating **complex objects into simpler single-value** representations is called
**serialization**. NEAR uses two serialization formats: [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and
[Borsh](https://borsh.io/).
1. [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is used to serialize the contract's input/output during a method call
2. [Borsh](https://borsh.io/) is used to serialize the contract's state.

## Overview of Serialization Formats

Lets give a quick overview of both serialization formats, including their pros and cons, as well as
an example on how their serializations look like.

<hr class="subsection" />

### [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html): Objects to Strings

#### Features
 - Self-describing format
 - Easy interoperability with JavaScript
 - Multiple implementations readily available
 - But... it is not efficient both in computational times and resulting size

#### Example
```js
Example{
  number: i32 = 2;
  arr: Vector<i32> = [0, 1];
}

// serializes to
"{\"number\": 2, \"arr\": [0, 1]}"
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### [Borsh](https://borsh.io/): Objects to Bytes

#### Features
  - Compact, binary format built to be efficiently (de)serialized
  - Strict and canonical binary representation
  - Less overhead: it does not need to store attributes names
  - But... it is necessary to know the schema to (de)serialize the data

#### Example
```js
Example{
  number: i32 = 2;
  arr: Vector<i32> = [0, 1];
}

// serializes into
[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Serializing Input & Output
NEAR contracts can implement methods that both take and return complex objects.
In order to handle this data in a simple way, JSON serialization is used.

Using JSON makes it easier for everyone to talk with the contracts, since most
languages readily implement a JSON (de)serializer.

#### Example
Let's look at this example, written only for educational purposes:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
#[serde(crate = "near_sdk::serde")]
pub struct A {
  pub a_number: i32,
  pub b_number: u128
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
#[serde(crate = "near_sdk::serde")]
pub struct B {
  pub success: bool,
  pub other_number: i32
}

pub fn method(&self, struct_a: A): B {
  return B{true, 0}
}
```


#### Receiving Data
When a user calls the `method`, the contract receives the arguments encoded as a JSON string
(e.g. `"{\"a_number\":0, \"b_number\":\"100\"}"`), and proceed to (de)serialize them into
the correct object (`A{0, 100}`) .


#### Returning Data
When returning the result, the contract will automatically encode the object `B{true, 0}`
into its JSON serialized value: `"{\"success\":true, \"other_number\":0}"` and return this
string.

:::caution JSON Limitations
Since JSON is limited to `52 bytes` numbers, you cannot use `u64`/`u128` as input
or output. JSON simply cannot serialize them. Instead, you must use `Strings`.

The `NEAR SDK RS` currently implements the `near_sdk::json_types::{U64, I64, U128, I128}`
that you can use for input / output of data.

## Borsh: State Serialization

Under the hood smart contracts store data using simple **key/value pairs**. This means that
the contract needs to translate complex states into simple key-value pairs.

For this, NEAR contracts use [borsh](https://borsh.io) which is optimized for (de)serializing
complex objects into smaller streams of bytes.

:::tip SDK-JS still uses json
The JavaScript SDK uses JSON to serialize objects in the state, but the borsh implementation
should arrive soon
:::

#### Example
Let's look at this example, written only for educational purposes:

```rust
#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize, PanicOnDefault)]
pub struct Contract {
  string: String,
  vector: Vector<u8>
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl Contract {
  #[init]
  pub fn init(string: String, first_u8: u8) -> Self {
    let mut vector: Vector<u8> = Vector::new("prefix".as_bytes());
    vector.push(&first_u8);

    Self { string, vector }
  }

  pub fn change_state(&mut self, string: String, number: u8) {
    self.string = string;
    self.vector.push(&number);
  }
}
```

#### Empty State On Deploy
If we deploy the contract into a new account and immediately ask for the state we will see
it is empty:

```bash
near view-state $CONTRACT --finality optimistic

# Result is: []
```

#### Initializing the State
If we initialize the state we can see how Borsh is used to serialize the state

```bash
# initialize with the string "hi" and 0
near call $CONTRACT init '{"string":"hi", "first_u8":0}' --accountId $CONTRACT

# check the state
near view-state $CONTRACT --utf8 --finality optimistic

# Result is:
# [
#   {
#     key: 'STATE',
#     value: '\x02\x00\x00\x00hi\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00prefix'
#   },
#   { key: 'prefix\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00', value: '\x00' }
# ]
```

The first key-value is:

```js
key: 'STATE'
value: '\x02\x00\x00\x00hi\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00prefix'
```

Since the `Contract` has a structure `string, Vector<u8>` the value is interpreted as:

```bash
[2, 0, 0, 0, "h", "i"] -> The `string` has 2 elements: "h" and "i".
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, "prefix"] -> The Vector has 1 element, and to see the values search for keys that start with (the 6 bytes prefix): "prefix"
```

Then, the second key-value shows the entries of the `Vector` denoted by the `"prefix"` string:

```js
key: 'prefix\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
value: '\x00'
```

#### Modifying the State
If we modify the stored string and add a new number, the state changes accordingly:

```bash
near call $CONTRACT change_state '{"string":"bye", "number":1}' --accountId $CONTRACT

# Result is
# [
#   {
#     key: 'STATE',
#     value: '\x03\x00\x00\x00bye\x02\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00prefix'
#   },
#   { key: 'prefix\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00', value: '\x00' },
#   { key: 'prefix\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00', value: '\x01' }
# ]
```

We can see that the `STATE` key changes to reflect the storage of the new string (`bye`), and that
the vector now has 2 elements.

At the same time, a new key-value was added adding the new vector entry: the `1u8` we just added.

<!-- We should see where to move/replicate this -->

### Deserialization Error
When somebody invokes a smart contract method, the first step for the contract is to deserialize
its own state.

In the example used above, the contract will start by reading the `STATE` key and
try to deserialize its value into an object `Contract{string: String, vector: Vector<u8>}`.

If you deploy a contract into the account with a different Contract structure, then the
contract will fail to deserialize the `STATE` key and panic `Cannot deserialize the contract state`.

To solve this, you can either:
1. Rollback to the previous contract code
2. Implement a method to [migrate the contract's state](../upgrade.md)
