Smart contracts have their own storage, which only they can modify but [anyone can see](../../4.tools/cli.md#near-view-state-near-view-state). At the lowest level, data is stored as key-value pairs. However, the SDKs abstracts this away, and provide common structures to simplify handling data.

## Attributes and Constants
You can store constants and define contract's attributes.

## Data Structures

Both [Rust SDK](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/) and [AssemblyScript SDK](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-as/) expose a series of data structures to simplify handling and storing data. In this page we showcase how to use the most common ones: Vectors, Sets, Maps and Trees. For the complete documentation please refer to the SDK pages.

:::caution
When initializing a data structure make sure to give it a **unique ID**, otherwise, it could point to other structure's key-value references.
:::

### Vector

Implements a [vector/array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) which persists in the contract's storage. Please refer to the Rust and AS SDK's for a full reference on their interfaces.

<blockquote class="lesson">
<strong>How do you update a property of an object within a PersistentVector?</strong><br /><br />
  
This question is specific to Assemblyscript. 

You have to replace the whole object. Persistent collections are ultimately just wrappers around storage.get and storage.set operating on JSON-serialized objects.
</blockquote>

### Map

Implements a [map/dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) which persists in the contract's storage. Please refer to the Rust and AS SDK's for a full reference on their interfaces.

  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

<blockquote class="lesson">
<strong>How is PersistentMap used?</strong><br /><br />
  
This question is specific to Assemblyscript. 

PersitentMap stores a key value pair, whereby the key is either a string or number and the value is usually an object. If you want to retrieve a particular value, you have to include the key to the value. 

The biggest advantage of an unordered map to a vector is, it prevents duplicate keys and saves searching time. As a result, if I have two more elements linked to the key and I want one of them to be unique, one of the solutions is to set the value type to another map.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="lesson">
<strong>Why is my call to `get` a value with default not passing type checks?</strong><br /><br />
  
You may need to use the TypeScript non-null assertion operator if you're trying to get a value, supplying a default and still failing type checks:

```ts
storage.get("my-var", "hello, default")!; // notice the ! at the end
```
</blockquote>

### Set

Implements a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) which persists in the contract's storage. Please refer to the Rust and AS SDK's for a full reference on their interfaces.

            start="1" end="11" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

### Tree

An ordered equivalent of Map. The underlying implementation is based on an [AVL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree). You should use this structure when you need to: have a consistent order, or access the min/max keys.

## Paying for Storage

Smart contracts pay for the storage used by locking a part of their balance. Therefore, the **more data** your contract stores, the **more money** you need to cover the storage cost. Currently, it cost approximately **1 â“ƒ** to store **100kb** of data. Be mindful of always having enough balance to cover your storage, and of potential [small deposit attacks](security/storage.md)


:::caution
If your contract runs out of NEAR to cover the storage, the next time it tries to add data it will halt execution with the error `Not enough balance to cover storage`.
