title: Reentrancy Attacks
---

Between a cross-contract call and its callback **any method of your contract can be executed**. Not taking this into account is one of the main sources of exploits. It is so common that it has its own name: **reentrancy attacks**.

Always make sure to keep your state in a consistent state after a method finishes executing. Assume that:

- Any method could be executed between a method execution and its callback.
- The same method could be executed again before the callback kicks in.

### Example
Imagine that we develop a `deposit_and_stake` with the following **wrong logic**: (1) The user sends us money, (2) we add it to its balance, (3) we try to stake it in a validator, (4) if the staking fails, we remove the balance in the callback. Then, a user could schedule a call to withdraw between (2) and (4), and, if the staking failed, we would send money twice to the user.

*Between a cross-contract call and the callback anything could happen*

Luckily for us the solution is rather simple. Instead of immediately adding the money to our userâ€™s balance, we wait until the callback. There we check, and if the staking went well, then we add it to their balance.
