---

All data stored on the NEAR blockchain is done in key / value pairs. There are several collection methods in the SDKs we've created that will help you store your data on chain.

- [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs) for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) smart contracts
- [`near-sdk-js`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js) for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) smart contracts

For information on storage costs, please see [ **[storage staking](/concepts/storage/storage-staking)** ].

### Big-O Notation {#big-o-notation-1}

> The [Big-O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) values in the chart below describe the [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) of the various collection methods found in `near-sdk-rs`. These method complexities correlate with [gas](/concepts/basics/transactions/gas) consumption on NEAR, helping you decide which collection to utilize in your project. There are three types found in our collection methods:

- O(1) - _[constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Constant_time)_
- O(n) - _[linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linear_time)_
- O(log n) - _[logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Logarithmic_time)_

| Type                                                          |  Access  |  Insert  |  Delete  |  Search  | Traverse | Clear |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :---: |
| [`Vector`](/concepts/storage/data-storage#vector)             |   O(1)   |  O(1)\*  | O(1)\*\* |   O(n)   |   O(n)   | O(n)  |
| [`LookupSet`](/concepts/storage/data-storage#lookupset)       |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   N/A    |  N/A  |
| [`UnorderedSet`](/concepts/storage/data-storage#unorderedset) |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(n)   | O(n)  |
| [`LookupMap`](/concepts/storage/data-storage#lookupmap)       |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   N/A    |  N/A  |
| [`UnorderedMap`](/concepts/storage/data-storage#unorderedmap) |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(1)   |   O(n)   | O(n)  |
| [`TreeMap`](/concepts/storage/data-storage#treemap)           | O(1) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) |   O(n)   | O(n)  |

_\* - to insert at the end of the vector using `push_back` (or `push_front` for deque)_

_\*\* - to delete from the end of the vector using `pop` (or `pop_front` for deque), or delete using `swap_remove` which swaps the element with the last element of the vector and then removes it._

### Gas Consumption Examples {#gas-consumption-examples-1}

> The examples below show differences in gas burnt storing and retrieving key/value pairs using the above methods. Please note that the gas cost of spinning up the runtime environment on chain has been deducted to show just data read/writes.
>
> You can reproduce this and test out your own data set by visiting [collection-examples-rs](https://github.com/near-examples/collection-examples-rs).

## Storage Constraints on NEAR

For storing data on-chain it’s important to keep in mind the following:

- Can add up in storage staking costs
- There is a 4mb limit on how much you can upload at once

Let’s say for example, someone wants to put an NFT purely on-chain (rather than IPFS or some other decentralized storage solution) you’ll have almost an unlimited amount of storage but will have to pay 1 $NEAR per 100kb of storage used (see Storage Staking).

Users will be limited to 4MB per contract call upload due to MAX_GAS constraints. The maximum amount of gas one can attach to a given functionCall is 300TGas.
