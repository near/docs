NEAR is a **user-friendly** and [**carbon-neutral**](https://near.org/blog/near-climate-neutral-product/) blockchain, built from the ground up to be performant, secure, and infinitely scalable.

In technical terms, NEAR is a [layer one](https://blockchain-comparison.com/blockchain-protocols/), [sharded](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption), [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) blockchain built with usability in mind.

In simple terms, NEAR is **blockchain for everyone**.

## Why Choose NEAR? {#why-build-on-near}
NEAR has been developed with a focus on performance and usability, both for developers and users.

### Simple to Use
1. Uses [**human-readable** accounts](./accounts/introduction.md#human-readable-accountsaccount-idmd) _(e.g. `alice.near`)_.
2. Leverages a **web-based wallet**, no need for users to install programs or browser extensions.
3. Possess a simple yet rich system of **Access Keys** to handle account permissions.

### Fast and Environmentally Friendly
1. Transactions are **incredibly fast** _(~1s transactions)_ and **cheap** _(<1¢ in fees).
2. The network is **[certified carbon-neutral](https://near.org/blog/the-near-blockchain-is-climate-neutral/)**.
3. NEAR **consumes in a year** the same energy [**bitcoin consumes in 3 minutes**](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/how-near-went-carbon-neutral-e656db96da47#:~:text=The%20firm%20found%20that%20NEAR,PoS%20technology%20instead%20of%20PoW).

### Great Developer Experience
1. Enables making smart contracts using **Javascript** or **Rust**.
2. **Simple onboarding**, thanks to its complete documentation and a multitude of examples.
3. NEAR DevRel holds **office hours every weekday**, where anybody can participate.
4. 30% of gas fees goes to the developers.
5. **Project funding** available through our [Grants Program](http://near.org/grants).

### A Technical Marvel
1. **Scales infinitely** and resists short-term usage spikes thanks to its [sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption).
2. **Interoperable with Ethereum** using [Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer) _(first trustless bridge ever created)_.
3. **EVM compatible** with [Project Aurora](http://www.aurora.dev) _(Deploy your Solidity contracts with ease)_.
