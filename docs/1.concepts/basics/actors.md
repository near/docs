title: Actors of NEAR
---

There are 3 main actors interacting to form the NEAR ecosystem:
1. The **users**, consuming the services provided by the NEAR network.
2. The **validators**, operating the computers that form the decentralized network.
3. The **blockchain**, working as the persistent storage for the network's transaction.

<!-- To set the stage, we're building a "base-layer blockchain," or a layer-one, meaning that it's on the same level of the ecosystem as projects like Ethereum or Cosmos. That means everything in the ecosystem is built on the NEAR blockchain, including your application. -->

## Users
Users can have one or multiple [NEAR accounts](./accounts/introduction.md), which they can use to:

1. **Transfer** tokens, such as the native [$NEAR token](token.md) or community-built ones.
2. **Execute** [decentralized apps](https://awesomenear.com) stored in the network, known as [smart contracts](./accounts/smartcontract.md).
3. **Develop** their own decentralized app and store it in the network.

## Validators
Validators are people distributed around the world, running the infrastructure that underlies the NEAR network. They serve two main jobs:

1. **Execute** the [transactions](transactions/overview.md) sent by the users, persisting their outcomes in the blockchain.
2. **Secure** the network by overseeing the rest of the validators and the blocks they create.
