An **epoch** is a unit of time when validators of the network remain constant. It is measured in blocks:

- Both `testnet` and `mainnet` have an epoch duration of 43,200 blocks. Ideally epochs last about 12 hours, since blocks are created every second (in reality, they take slightly longer to be created).
- You can view this setting by querying the **[`protocol_config`](/api/rpc/setup#protocol-config)** RPC endpoint and searching for `epoch_length`.

**Note:** Nodes garbage collect blocks after 5 epochs (~2.5 days) unless they are [archival nodes](https://near-nodes.io/intro/node-types#archival-node).

**Example:**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON" default>

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "EXPERIMENTAL_protocol_config",
  "params": {
    "finality": "final"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="http" label="HTTPie">

```bash
http post https://rpc.testnet.near.org jsonrpc=2.0 id=dontcare method=EXPERIMENTAL_protocol_config \
  params:='{
    "finality": "final"
  }'
```
