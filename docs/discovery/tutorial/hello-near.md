title: Smart Contract Interaction
---

Your frontend can interact with different blockchains using the built-in Discovery API. Let's see how to create an application that reads and stores a greeting from a NEAR smart contract.

## The Contract

We have deployed a `Hello World` smart contract in the NEAR network at `hello.near-examples.near`. The contract exposes two methods:
- `set_greeting(greeting: string): void`, which accepts a greeting and stores it in the contract state.
- `get_greeting(): string` which returns the stored greeting.

---

## Retrieving the Greeting
Since we want to interact with the NEAR network, we will use the `Near` object from the Discovery API.

```ts
const contract = "hello.near-examples.near";
const greeting = Near.view(contract, "get_greeting", {});

return <div>{greeting} World</div>;
```

Assuming the contract is storing `"Hello"`, this will render a simple:

```json
Hello World
```

---

## Changing the Greeting
To modify the greeting, we simply need to use `Near.call` to call the `set_greeting` method. This however, requires us to have a frontend in which the user can input the new greeting.

Lets create it in two steps:
1. Build the HTML that will be rendered
2. Add the logic to handle the method call

<hr class="subsection" />

### 1. HTML Components
Use the following code to create a simple frontend, composed by a title, an input form to change the greeting, and a button to submit the change.

```js
const contract = "hello.near-examples.near";
const greeting = Near.view(contract, "get_greeting", {});

// Define components
const greetingForm = (
  <>
    <div class="border border-black p-3">
      <label>Update greeting</label>
      <input placeholder="Howdy" onChange={onInputChange} />
      <button class="btn btn-primary mt-2" onClick={onBtnClick}>
        Save
      </button>
    </div>
  </>
);

const notLoggedInWarning = <p> Login to change the greeting </p>;

// Render
return (
  <>
    <div class="container border border-info p-3">
      <h3 class="text-center">
        The contract says:
        <span class="text-decoration-underline"> {greeting} </span>
      </h3>

      <p class="text-center py-2">
        Look at that! A greeting stored on the NEAR blockchain.
      </p>

      {context.accountId ? greetingForm : notLoggedInWarning}
    </div>
  </>
);
```

:::info Relevant HTML
There are two important things to notice in the code above:

1. **onChange & onClick**: We have prepared our `<input>` and `<button>` to act when something happens. Particularly, we will build two methods: one when the input changes, and one when the button is pressed.

2. **context.accountId**: We check if `context.accountId` is set, which tells us if the user has logged in using their NEAR account, and thus can interact with NEAR contracts.

### 2. Handling User's Input
Having our component's view ready, we now need to define the logic for when the user inputs a new greeting and presses the `Submit` button. This is, we need to define the `onInputChange` and `onBtnClick` methods.

#### onInputChange
When the user inputs a new greeting, we want to store it somewhere until the `Submit` button is pressed, for this, we can use the [application's State](../api/state.md).

In Discovery, the state is initialized through `State.init`, updated with `State.update`, and accessed through the `state` variable (notice the lowercase). Lets store the new greeting in the App's state:

```jsx
State.init({ new_greeting: "" });

const onInputChange = ({ target }) => {
  State.update({ new_greeting: target.value });
};
```

#### onBtnClick
The only thing left to do, is to handle when the user clicks the `Submit` button. What we want is to check if the user changed the greeting, and submit it to the contract.

```jsx
const onBtnClick = () => {
  if (!state.new_greeting) {
    return;
  }

  Near.call(contract, "set_greeting", {
    greeting: state.new_greeting,
  });
};
```
