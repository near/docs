title: Built-in Components
---

In Discovery, you build small apps known as `Components`, that focus on solving a specific problem. Then, you compose these `Components` to achieve a full-working frontend.

To simplify development, Discovery provides a set of built-in components that  you can readily use to build your decentralized frontend.
