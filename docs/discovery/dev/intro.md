Software development under a new framework or technology can be challenging for newcomers.
To help and speed-up the learning curve, we are sharing the tools and experience gathered by NEAR developers.

In this section you'll find some tools and suggested workflows that should simplify your experience when developing new code and components for [NEAR Blockchain Operating System](https://near.org/blog/near-announces-the-blockchain-operating-system/) (BOS).

## Local Tools

The quickest way to do some coding on BOS is using the in-browser editor, but that's probably not going to do it when you are working on a long-term project where you need version control, automated testing, deployment, and other additional workflows.

Here you have a list local tools such as CLIs and VS extensions, that you can install and integrate with your existing development environment to build your projects on NEAR BOS.

- [BOS CLI](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs): a command line utility that simplifies local component development for NEAR Discovery.
- [BOS Loader](bos-loader.md): a CLI tool to preview local components in NEAR Discovery.
- [VS Code Extension](vscode.md): an extension to help you develop components using VS Code.
