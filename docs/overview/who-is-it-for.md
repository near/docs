The short answer is: **Anyone with an interest in NEAR Protocol.**

You may be a designer, developer, student, manager, engineer, artist, researcher, or you come from any other background. We are glad that you found your path to exploring what NEAR is all about!

If you're not sure what **NEAR Protocol** is, you should start with a soft intro. 

* [What's NEAR?](overview/what-is-near.md)

#### Before we begin, it will be helpful to have a general understanding of:

* [Smart Contract Basics](quick-start/blockchain-prerequisite.md)
* [NEAR Smart Contract Development Overview](quick-start/development-overview.md)

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started is by coding in NEAR studio, our fully hosted IDE. Take a look at our [Near Studio walkthrough](quick-start/near-studio-ide.md).

#### If you want to build locally, take a look at:

* [Local development guide](local-setup/local-dev-testnet.md)

#### Looking to start writing smart contracts? Take a look at:

* [Writing Contracts on NEAR](development/writing-smart-contracts.md)
* [Calling Contracts on NEAR](development/calling-smart-contracts.md)

In this section, you will also find more information on Near-specific methods and functions.

#### To learn more about becoming a validator, checkout the validator section:

* [Running a node](local-setup/running-testnet.md)

## Tutorials

The [Tutorials](tutorials/tutorial-overview.md) section contains several tutorials which will help you learn how to build, test and deploy smart contracts.

We recommend you start with the [Zero to Hero tutorial](tutorials/zero-to-hero.md) which will show you how to save complex data structures to the blockchain, and bridge on-chain and off-chain services.

* [Zero to Hero: Building an Oracle ](tutorials/zero-to-hero.md)
* [Create your own ERC-20 token smart contract](tutorials/token.md)
* [Writing contracts that talk to each other](tutorials/how-to-write-contracts-that-talk-to-each-other.md)

An most importantly, we will show you how to test your smart contracts:
* [Test your smart contracts](tutorials/test-your-smart-contracts.md)

## API Documentation

Here are the reference docs for all of our supported libraries. We actively support an AssemblyScript runtime \(TypeScript -&gt; WASM compiler\), a Rust runtime, the base RPC and a JavaScript library. These docs are auto-generated and less user-friendly! They should be used for advanced users and those who need to look up how something works.

* [TypeScript Contracts](development/writing-smart-contracts.md) -- covers the same topic, but for AssemblyScript
* [RPC](interaction/rpc.md) -- covers the actual core API responses and actions you can call
* [nearlib.js](nearlib/globals.md) -- is autogenerated documentation for the JavaScript integration library
* [Rust Contracts](near-bindgen/near-bindgen.md) -- covers the API for creating apps with Rust
