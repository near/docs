## At Near, we can differentiate between the following three entities

### NEAR Protocol
The NEAR Protocol is a permissionless, Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol that anyone can access, add transactions to, or read from. The public NEAR blockchain is an instantiation of the reference code at http://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore, but theoretically this repo could be forked and deployed as a separate chain, as much as many protocols have done to build upon the core Bitcoin code.

### The NEAR Foundation
A non-profit foundation headquartered in Switzerland, and is responsible for contracting protocol maintainers, funding ecosystem development, and shepherding core governance of the protocol.

### Near Inc
A US-based software research and development company that did much of the early development of the protocol and its tooling. While Near Inc does not own or run the NEAR Protocol (which is decentralized), it continues to propose changes to the reference implementation codebase as one of multiple third party entities performing R&D work for the protocol.

## What´s important for you?
The first implementation of the NEAR Protocol is done by Near Inc. It is a permissionless, open-source blockchain that anyone can write to and read from. 

We will show you exactly how in this document!
