Welcome! If you are searching how to interact with a smart contract (that maybe you [developed?](broken)), you have come to the right place. Do not worry if you have never implemented a contract yourself, during these pages we will abstract contracts as remote services. This is, for us a contract is a deployed server that exposes an API. Through such an API we can query information and execute the contract’s code.

Particularly, in this page we will showcase how to:
Interact with a contract from the command line interface
Integrate a smart contract into a web application, i.e. create a frontend
Query usage information such as “which users called a specific method in the contract?”

Are you searching for a different type of documentation?. Information on how to develop a smart contract can be [found here](broken). An overview of the NEAR platform and how it works [be found here](broken).

If while reading this page you have any questions, please feel free to join our community on [Discord](http://near.chat/) and reach out! We are here to help.

### Searching for the API?
If you are an advanced user searching for the APIs, they can be found here:

- [near-api-js](broken): The javascript API
- [near-rpc](broken): The RPC API
- [near-cli](broken): The NEAR Command Line Interface
