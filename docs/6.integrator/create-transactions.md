To construct & process transactions you will need our API JavaScript library: [`near-api-js`](/develop/integrate/frontend). There are many ways to create transactions but for this example we'll show you two ways to create a simple token transfer transaction.

- [HIGH LEVEL](#high-level----create-a-transaction) - _easiest way to create a transaction_
- [LOW LEVEL](#low-level----create-a-transaction) - _performs the exact same transaction as above, but deconstructs the entire process for those curious about each step_

At the core, all transactions require the following:

- `signerId` _(account ID of the transaction originator)_
- `signerPublicKey`
- `receiverId` _(account ID of the transaction recipient)_
- `nonceForPublicKey` _(each time a key is used the nonce value should be incremented by 1)_
- `actions` _( [[click here]](/concepts/basics/transactions/overview#action) for supported arguments)_
- `blockHash` _(a current block hash (within 24hrs) to prove the transaction was recently created)_

See [Transaction Class](https://near.github.io/near-api-js/classes/transaction.Transaction) for a more in depth outline.

---

## HIGH LEVEL -- Create a transaction {#high-level----create-a-transaction}

### Setup {#setup}

1. Clone the [transaction-examples](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples) repository by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples.git
```

2. Follow [setup instructions](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)

### Imports {#imports}

In [`send-tokens-easy.js`](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples/blob/9e999253aafa2c3e3b537810a0b8ce7596c3506c/send-tokens-easy.js#L1-L5) we use two dependencies:

1. [NEAR API JavaScript library](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)
2. [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (used to load environment variables for private key)

```js
const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");
const { connect, KeyPair, keyStores, utils } = nearAPI;
require("dotenv").config();
```

The second line above deconstructs several utilities from nearAPI that you will use to interact with the blockchain.

- `connect` - create a connection to NEAR passing configuration variables
- `KeyPair` - creates a keyPair from the private key you'll provide in an `.env` file
- `keyStores` - stores the keyPair that you will create from the private key and used to sign Transactions
- `utils` - used to format NEAR amounts

### Accounts & Network {#accounts--network}

Next, you'll need to enter the `accountId` of the `sender` and `receiver`, as well as the `networkId` (`betanet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet`).

```js
const sender = "sender.testnet";
const receiver = "receiver.testnet";
const networkId = "testnet";
```

### Formatting Token Amounts {#formatting-token-amounts}

When sending NEAR tokens (Ⓝ) during a transaction, the amount needs to be converted into [Yocto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto-) Ⓝ or (10^-24).

- To perform this you will use the [`near-api-js`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js) method [`parseNearAmount()`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/utils/format.ts#L53-L63) (located in `utils/format`)

```js
const amount = nearAPI.utils.format.parseNearAmount("1.5");
```

### Create a Key Store {#create-a-key-store}

In order to sign transactions you will need to create a "Key Store" that will hold a [full access key](/concepts/basics/accounts/access-keys#full-access-keys) to sign your transactions. There are several ways to accomplish this, but for this example we will use a private key stored in either an `.env` file in your project or an environment variable exported globally.

- If you created the account using [`near-cli`](/tools/near-cli) or ran [`near login`](/tools/near-cli#for-accounts) in your terminal, your private key can be found in a `.json` file located in `/HOME/.near-credentials`.
- If you created an account using [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/), your key will be found in your browser's `Local Storage`.
  - In your browser's dev tools... `Application` >> `Storage` >> `Local Storage`

```js
// sets up an empty keyStore object in memory using near-api-js
const keyStore = new keyStores.InMemoryKeyStore();
// creates a keyPair from the private key provided in your .env file
const keyPair = KeyPair.fromString(process.env.SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY);
// adds the key you just created to your keyStore which can hold multiple keys (must be inside an async function)
await keyStore.setKey(networkId, sender, keyPair);
```

### Setting up a connection to NEAR {#setting-up-a-connection-to-near}

Now create a connection to NEAR using a configuration object that will contain your `networkId` setup earlier as well as your `keyStore`.

```js
// configuration used to connect to NEAR
const config = {
  networkId,
  keyStore,
  nodeUrl: `https://rpc.${networkId}.near.org`,
  walletUrl: `https://wallet.${networkId}.near.org`,
  helperUrl: `https://helper.${networkId}.near.org`,
  explorerUrl: `https://explorer.${networkId}.near.org`,
};

// connect to NEAR! :)
const near = await connect(config);
// create a NEAR account object
const senderAccount = await near.account(sender);
```

You'll notice the last line uses your NEAR connection to create a `senderAccount` object that you'll use to perform the transaction.

### Create, Sign, & Send Transaction {#create-sign--send-transaction}

Now that everything is setup, creating the transaction is a single line of code.

```js
const result = await senderAccount.sendMoney(receiver, amount);
```

This simple command constructs, signs, and sends a token transfer transaction on the NEAR blockchain. There is not a need to create a `result` variable aside from inspecting the response details from your transaction and even create a link to [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/) to view a GUI version of the transaction details.

## LOW LEVEL -- Create a Transaction {#low-level----create-a-transaction}

### Setup {#setup-1}

1. Clone the [transaction-examples](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples) repository by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples.git
```

2. Follow [setup instructions](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)

---

### Imports {#imports-1}

In [`send-tokens-deconstructed.js`](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples/blob/master/send-tokens-deconstructed.js#L1-L4) we use three dependencies:

1. [NEAR API JavaScript library](https://github.com/near/near-api-js)
2. [`js-sha256`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-sha256) (cryptographic hashing algorithm)
3. [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (used to load environment variables)

```js
const nearAPI = require("near-api-js");
const sha256 = require("js-sha256");
require("dotenv").config();
```

---

### Accounts & Network {#accounts--network-1}

Next, you'll need to enter the `accountId` of the `sender` and `receiver`, as well as the `networkId` (`betanet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet`).

```js
const sender = "sender.testnet";
const receiver = "receiver.testnet";
const networkId = "testnet";
```

---

### Formatting Token Amounts {#formatting-token-amounts-1}

When sending NEAR tokens (Ⓝ) during a transaction, the amount needs to be converted into [Yocto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto-) Ⓝ or (10^-24).

- To perform this you will use the [`near-api-js`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js) method [`parseNearAmount()`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/utils/format.ts#L53-L63) (located in `utils/format`)

```js
const amount = nearAPI.utils.format.parseNearAmount("1.5");
```

---

### Setting up a connection to NEAR {#setting-up-a-connection-to-near-1}

In this example, we will create a NEAR RPC `provider` that allows us to interact with the chain via [RPC endpoints](/api/rpc/introduction).

```js
const provider = new nearAPI.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  `https://rpc.${networkId}.near.org`
);
```

---

### Access Keys {#access-keys}

To sign a transaction to send NEAR Ⓝ, we will need a `FullAccess` key to the sender's account.

- If you created the account using [`near-cli`](/tools/near-cli) or ran [`near login`](/tools/near-cli#for-accounts) in your terminal, your private key can be found in a `.json` file located in `/HOME/.near-credentials`.
- If you created an account using [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/), your key will be found in your browser's `Local Storage`.
  - In your browser's dev tools... `Application` >> `Storage` >> `Local Storage`

Once you have access to the private key of the sender's account, create an environment variable `SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY` or hard code it as a string on [line 18](https://github.com/near-examples/transaction-examples/blob/master/send-tokens-deconstructed.js#L18) of `send-tokens.js`.

- With this `privateKey`, we can now construct a `keyPair` object to sign transactions.

```js
const privateKey = process.env.SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY;
const keyPair = nearAPI.utils.key_pair.KeyPairEd25519.fromString(privateKey);
```

---

### Transaction Requirements {#transaction-requirements}

As stated before, all transactions require six parts:

1. [`signerId`](#1-signerid)
2. [`signerPublicKey`](#2-signerpublickey)
3. [`receiverId`](#3-receiverid)
4. [`nonceForPublicKey`](#4-nonceforpublickey)
5. [`actions`](/concepts/basics/transactions/overview#action)
6. [`blockHash`](#6-blockhash)

### 1 `signerId` {#1-signerid}

- The `signerId` is the account ID of the transaction originator.
- This value is passed as a string (ex. `'example.testnet'` or `'bob.near'`)

### 2 `signerPublicKey` {#2-signerpublickey}

- The `signerPublicKey` is required to be an object with two key value pairs: `keyType` and `data`.

```js
PublicKey = {
  keyType: 0,
  data: Uint8Array(32)[
    (190,
    150,
    152,
    145,
    232,
    248,
    128,
    151,
    167,
    165,
    128,
    46,
    20,
    231,
    103,
    142,
    39,
    56,
    152,
    46,
    135,
    1,
    161,
    180,
    94,
    212,
    195,
    201,
    73,
    190,
    70,
    242)
  ],
};
```

- This can be constructed by calling `getPublicKey()` using the `keyPair` we [setup earlier](#access-keys).

```js
const publicKey = keyPair.getPublicKey();
```

### 3 `receiverId` {#3-receiverid}

- The `receiverId` is the account ID of the transaction recipient.
- This value is passed as a string (ex. `'example.testnet'` or `'bob.near'`)
- The certain cases, the `signerId` and the `receiverId` can be the same account.

### 4 `nonceForPublicKey` {#4-nonceforpublickey}

- A unique number or `nonce` is required for each transaction signed with an access key.
- To ensure a unique number is created for each transaction, the current `nonce` should be queried and then incremented by 1.
- Current nonce can be retrieved using the `provider` we [created earlier](#setting-up-a-connection-to-near).

```js
const accessKey = await provider.query(
  `access_key/${sender}/${publicKey.toString()}`,
  ""
);
```

- now we can create a unique number for our transaction by incrementing the current `nonce`.

```js
const nonce = ++accessKey.nonce;
```

### 5 `actions` {#5-actions}

- There are currently eight supported `Action` types. [[see here]](/concepts/basics/transactions/overview#action)
- For this example, we are using `Transfer`
- This transfer action can be created using the [imported `nearAPI` object](#imports) and the [formatted Ⓝ amount](#formatting-token-amounts) created earlier.

```js
const actions = [nearAPI.transactions.transfer(amount)];
```

[[click here]](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/transaction.ts#L70-L72) to view source for `transfer()`.

### 6 `blockHash` {#6-blockhash}

- Each transaction requires a current block hash (within 24hrs) to prove that the transaction was created recently.
- Hash must be converted to an array of bytes using the `base_decode` method found in [`nearAPI`](#imports).

```js
const recentBlockHash = nearAPI.utils.serialize.base_decode(
  accessKey.block_hash
);
```

[[click here]](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/utils/serialize.ts#L16-L17) to view source for `base_decode()`.

---

### Constructing the Transaction {#constructing-the-transaction}

With all of our [required arguments](#transaction-requirements), we can construct the transaction.

- Using [`nearAPI`](#imports), we call on `createTransaction()` to perform this task.

```js
const transaction = nearAPI.transactions.createTransaction(
  sender,
  publicKey,
  receiver,
  nonce,
  actions,
  recentBlockHash
);
```

[[click here]](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/transaction.ts#L95-L110) to view source code for the Transaction class

---

### Sign Transaction {#sign-transaction}

Now that the transaction is created, we sign it before sending it to the NEAR blockchain. At the lowest level, there are four steps to this process.

1. Using [`nearAPI`](#imports), we call on `serialize()` to serialize the transaction in [Borsh](https://borsh.io/).

```js
const serializedTx = nearAPI.utils.serialize.serialize(
  nearAPI.transactions.SCHEMA,
  transaction
);
```

2. Hash the serialized transaction using a `sha256` cryptographic hashing algorithm.

```js
const serializedTxHash = new Uint8Array(sha256.sha256.array(serializedTx));
```

3. Create a signature with the `keyPair`.

```js
const signature = keyPair.sign(serializedTxHash);
```

4. Construct the signed transaction using `near-api-js` [SignedTransaction class](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/blob/d4d4cf1ac3182fa998b1e004e6782219325a641b/src/transaction.ts#L112-L123).

```js
const signedTransaction = new nearAPI.transactions.SignedTransaction({
  transaction,
  signature: new nearAPI.transactions.Signature({
    keyType: transaction.publicKey.keyType,
    data: signature.signature,
  }),
});
```

### Send Transaction {#send-transaction}

Final step is to encode and send the transaction.

- First we serialize transaction into [Borsh](https://borsh.io/), and store the result as `signedSerializedTx`. _(required for all transactions)_
- Then we send the transaction via [RPC call](/api/rpc/introduction) using the `sendJsonRpc()` method nested inside [`near`](#setting-up-connection-to-near).

```js
// encodes transaction to serialized Borsh (required for all transactions)
const signedSerializedTx = signedTransaction.encode();
// sends transaction to NEAR blockchain via JSON RPC call and records the result
const result = await provider.sendJsonRpc("broadcast_tx_commit", [
  Buffer.from(signedSerializedTx).toString("base64"),
]);
```

### Transaction Results {#transaction-results}

Detailed transaction results of the transaction are returned in the following format:

```bash
{
  status: { SuccessValue: '' },
  transaction: {
    signer_id: 'sender.testnet',
    public_key: 'ed25519:8RazSLHvzj4TBSKGUo5appP7wVeqZNQYjP9hvhF4ZKS2',

      outcome: [Object]
    }
  ]
}
Transaction Results:  {
  signer_id: 'sender.testnet',
  public_key: 'ed25519:8RazSLHvzj4TBSKGUo5appP7wVeqZNQYjP9hvhF4ZKS2',
  nonce: 57,
  receiver_id: 'receiver.testnet',
  actions: [ { Transfer: [Object] } ],

  hash: 'EgGzB73eFxCwZRGcEyCKedLjvvgxhDXcUtq21SqAh79j'
}
```
