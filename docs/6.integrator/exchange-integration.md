## Blocks and Finality {#blocks-and-finality}

Some important pieces of information regarding blocks and finality include:

- Expected block time is around 1s and expected time to finality is around 2s. The last final block can be queried by
  specifying `{"finality": "final"}` in the block query. For example, to get the latest final block on mainnet, one can run

```bash
http post https://rpc.mainnet.near.org method=block params:='{"finality":"final"}' id=123 jsonrpc=2.0
```

- Block height are not necessarily continuous and certain heights may be skipped if, for example, a block producer for that height is offline. For example, after a block at height 100 is produced, the block at height 101 may be skipped. When block at height 102 is produced, its previous block is the block at height 100.

- Some blocks may not include new chunks if, for example, the previous chunk producer is offline. Even though in the RPC
  return result every block will have non-empty `chunks` field, it does not imply that there is a new chunk included in the block.
  The way to tell whether the chunk is included in the block is to check whether `height_included` in the chunk is the same
  as the height of the block.
