Here we address [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64378144/why-cant-i-read-this-hashmap-in-a-near-contract/64438703#64438703) on StackOverflow and specifically, we'll talk about why you'll likely want to use NEAR Collections instead of `HashMap` when using Rust. See a list of the available collections [here](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/collections/index.html). In this video we discuss:

- [`U128`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/json_types/struct.U128.html) and the difference between the (lowercase) `u128`
- why JSON cannot handle very large numbers
- how to interact with a Rust smart contract using NEAR CLI
- demonstrate logging, `view` and `call` methods, and unit tests 
- benefits of creating subaccounts

We will also walk through the process of writing, building, and deploying a Rust smart contract and then we'll discover why NEAR subaccounts are useful when you may need to make breaking changes to state.
