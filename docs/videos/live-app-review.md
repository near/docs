> **Learn how to make a Payments API that accepts NEAR tokens.**
>
> - Manage a unique address that user's can deposit to with their username + some meta data.
> - "enter a tournament" by submitting a username and a tournament name.
> - An account is generated and you send NEAR to the account.
> - Finally, deposit the near and the payments API destroys the temporary account and takes the funds.

> **We do a demo of creating a "guest" named account for an app where the gas fees are sponsored by a special app account**
>
> - The guest account doesn't exist (sometimes called a virtual or contract account) until the user upgrades, but the name is reserved because only the app is able to create `USERNAME.APP_NAME.near`.
> - This has many advantages for user onboarding, where users can use the app immediately and later can be upgraded to a full account. The users also don't have to move any assets - namely the fungible tokens they earned as a guest user.

## Ep. # 13 - Social Token Drops

</iframe>

> **Dropping tokens to users in the traditional Web2 way!**
>
> - One of the issues with Social Tokens is that they start with zero value. A creator, artist or community might want to drop a bunch of tokens to their fans but the audience has (1) no crypto to pay for fees (2) no wallet (3) no concept of crypto or blockchain; prior to the drop.
> - We do a demo of creating a "guest" named account for an app where the gas fees are sponsored by a special app account called `guests.APP_NAME.near`.
> - The guest account doesn't exist (sometimes called a virtual or contract account) until the user decides to swap their tokens and upgrade to a real account. Until then their name is reserved because only the app is able to create `USERNAME.APP_NAME.near`.
> - This has many advantages for user onboarding, where users can use the app immediately and later can be upgraded to a full account.

>
> - Before your users have to run out, get a wallet and buy crypto, let them enjoy the features of your app, join your community and create some value.
> - NEAR Protocol lets developers create named sub-accounts for apps, sponsor gas fees and seamlessly upgrade those accounts to a full account where the user can connect the wallet of their choice!

> **You wanna deploy some Fungible or Non-Fungible tokens, but you don't know how much it's going to cost?**
>
> - Does it make business sense to offload your security and allow your users to custody their own tokens to be part of the Web3 revolution?
> - Find out how to profile your gas costs against the NEAR Protocol Testnet using only JavaScript! It's fun and easy to write tests and add in some gas profiling logic.
