The [near-web3-provider](https://github.com/near/near-web3-provider) is a custom provider that can be used when working in a Web3 environment. There are two typical use cases for a Web3 provider:

1. [Front-end](#front-end) — interacting with smart contracts via a user interface on the web
2. [Back-end](#back-end) — typically testing and deploying EVM-based contracts or using NEAR CLI. Anything where there is not a website front-end interacting with smart contracts.

## Front-end

The [NPM package](https://npmjs.com/package/near-web3-provider) can be added to a NodeJS project with:

    npm install near-web3-provider --save

Or, to follow the snippets below, you may want to use:

    npm install near-web3-provider web3-eth-contract --save

In the front-end JavaScript the provider can be instantiated with its constructor. There are two modes of a `NearProvider` class:

1. Read-only — can only access `view` calls to the NEAR EVM.
2. Signed — has access to a NEAR account and can interact with `view` and `call` methods.

**Note**: in Ethereum, executing a read-only method is referred to as `call`, while a state-changing method is referred to as `send`. In NEAR, it's `view` and `call` and this terminology will be used widely in the documentation.

### Instantiating read-only

```js
const { NearProvider } = require('near-web3-provider');
// …
const nearProvider = new NearProvider({
  networkId: this.nearNetwork,
  keyStore: new nearAPI.keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),
  isReadOnly: true
});
```

### Instantiating signed

For the signed instance, this assumes that the browser has local storage containing a key to the account specified.

For folks unfamiliar with NEAR Wallet, a brief recap as the workflow in NEAR is
different than that of a browser extension or by scanning QR codes. Let's
imagine a user wants to use a NEAR TestNet account to interact with the EVM. The
first step is to create an account with Wallet. (Non-mainnet networks allow for
free account creation with an initial balance of Ⓝ.)

NEAR TestNet Wallet:

https://wallet.testnet.near.org

At this point, the NEAR Wallet website's local storage contains a key for this account. When you want to interact with a front-end using your account, you'll typically have the front-end redirect to Wallet, requesting the creation a special function-call access key. After allowing the creation, the browser redirects back to the dApp front-end with local storage containing this new key.

```js
const { NearProvider } = require('near-web3-provider');
// …
const nearProvider = new NearProvider({
  networkId: this.nearNetwork,
  masterAccountId: 'yourname.testnet', // NEAR account with key that exists in local storage
  keyStore: new nearAPI.keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),
});
```

### Contract abstraction, set the provider

Web3 developers are able to use familiar libraries for contract abstraction. For instance, in the case of the Pet Shop example, a `Contract` object is instantiated using the NPM package [`web3-eth-contract`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-eth-contract).

Then a `Contract` object can use methods like [`send`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-send) and [`call`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-call).

```js
const Contract = require('web3-eth-contract');
const { NearProvider, utils } = require('near-web3-provider');
const path = require('path');
const credentialsPath = path.join(os.homedir(), '.near-credentials');

const yourBetanetAccount = 'yourname.testnet'; // NEAR account with key that exists in local storage
const nearProvider = new NearProvider({
  networkId: this.nearNetwork,
  masterAccountId: yourBetanetAccount,
  keyStore: new nearAPI.keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(credentialsPath),
});

const myContractArtifact = require('path/to/build/contracts/MyContract.json');
const networkId = nearProvider.version;
const myContractAddress = myContractArtifact.networks[networkId].address;
const myContract = new Contract(myContractArtifact.abi, myContractAddress, {
  from: myContractAddress
});
myContract.setProvider(nearProvider);
// view-only
const viewResult = myContract.methods.myViewMethod().call();
// signed
const yourBetanetAccountAsEthAddress = utils.nearAccountToEvmAddress(yourBetanetAccount);
const signedResult = myContract.methods.mutateStateMethod().send({from: yourBetanetAccountAsEthAddress});
```

This covers the basic usage of `near-web3-provider` on the front-end, allowing your Ethereum smart contracts to interact with a website.

## Back-end

### Simple EVM interaction

The code below is taken from [this example repository](https://github.com/near-examples/evm-simple). That project will contain the private keys needed to run this demonstration.

In 42 lines, we'll interact with a contract on the NEAR EVM:

```js
const Contract = require('web3-eth-contract');
const { NearProvider, utils, nearAPI } = require('near-web3-provider');

Demo = {
  start: async function() {
    await this.callEvm('mike.testnet');
    console.log('-------------------')
    await this.callEvm('josh.testnet');
  },

  callEvm: async function(testnetAccount) {
    console.log(`Interacting with ${testnetAccount}`);
    const nearProvider = new NearProvider({
      networkId: 'testnet',
      masterAccountId: testnetAccount,
      // See list of near-api-js keystores here: https://near.github.io/near-api-js/classes/_key_stores_keystore_.keystore.html
      keyStore: new nearAPI.keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore('./private-keys'),
    });
    // See the NEAR Pet Shop example at: https://github.com/near-examples/near-pet-shop
    const myContractArtifact = require('./build/contracts/Adoption.json');
    const networkId = nearProvider.version;
    console.log('aloha networkId', networkId);
    const myContractAddress = myContractArtifact.networks[networkId].address;
    const myContract = new Contract(myContractArtifact.abi, myContractAddress, {
      from: myContractAddress
    });
    myContract.setProvider(nearProvider);
    // signed
    const testnetAccountAsEthAddress = utils.nearAccountToEvmAddress(testnetAccount); // could also get the account with web3.eth.getAccounts
    console.log(`The NEAR account ${testnetAccount} is ${testnetAccountAsEthAddress} on the EVM`);
    console.log('Setting first item to the EVM account…')
    // We're setting the first entry in the array to be the accounts EVM address
    const signedResult = await myContract.methods.adopt(0).send({from: testnetAccountAsEthAddress});
    let transactionHash = signedResult.transactionHash.split(':')[0];
    console.log(`View transaction in NEAR Explorer: https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/${transactionHash}`);
    // view-only
    console.log('Retrieving state…')
    const viewResult = await myContract.methods.getAdopters().call();
    console.log('viewResult', viewResult);
  }
}
Demo.start();
```

Note that we can use common libraries from the Ethereum ecosystem like `web3-eth-contract` as we have here. Once the keys and contract object is set up, you may interact with:

`view`
```js
const readOnlyResult = await myContract.methods.readOnlyMethodName().call();
```

`call`
```js
const transactionResult = await myContract.methods.changeStateMethodName(argValue).send({from: accountAsEthAddress});
```

### Compiling and deploying a Solidity contract

The [NEAR Pet Shop example](https://github.com/near-examples/near-pet-shop) also demonstrates both front-end and back-end with regards to building and deploying using Truffle's `migrate` command. Please see the NEAR documentation [Truffle page](/docs/develop/evm/truffle) for details on this.

### NEAR CLI

You can interact with an EVM smart contract with NEAR CLI, the command-line interface tool. With NodeJS version 12+, you may install this globally with:

    npm install -g near-cli

For more information see the [NEAR CLI documentation](/docs/tools/near-cli).

Be sure to have followed the instructions earlier on creating a TestNet NEAR
account with Wallet. Issue this command to create a full-access key file
locally:

    env NEAR_ENV=testnet near login

The key file will be located at `~/.near-credentials/testnet/yourname.testnet.json`.

Now we're ready to use NEAR CLI to interact with a smart contract on the NEAR EVM. Let's say we've used Truffle to build and deploy a smart contract as [detailed in this guide](/docs/develop/evm/truffle#build-and-deploy), and the **contract address** is output as `0xAdf11a39283CEB00DEB90a5cE9220F89c6C27E67`. In this case the contract is NEAR Pet Shop example mentioned earlier. There is a read-only method `getAdopters` and a method that changes state called `adopt`.

View with `aurora view`:

    NEAR_ENV=testnet aurora view evm 0xAdf11a39283CEB00DEB90a5cE9220F89c6C27E67 getAdopters '[]' --abi ~/path/to/near-pet-shop/build/contracts/Adoption.json --accountId yourname.testnet

The `aurora view` command returns an array of addresses, each corresponding to the index of a dog. Dogs open for adoption have the value of the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) and dogs already adopted contain the address of the account that's adopted them.

At the time of this writing, the previous CLI command returns:

```shell script
[
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', ⟵ we will be adopting this dog
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C', ⟵ josh.testnet
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C', ⟵ josh.testnet
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C', ⟵ josh.testnet
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C'  ⟵ josh.testnet
]
```

As shown above, the "dog" at index 0 (the first in the array) has the zero address and is therefore open for adoption.

Call and mutate state with `aurora call`:

    NEAR_ENV=testnet aurora call evm 0xAdf11a39283CEB00DEB90a5cE9220F89c6C27E67 adopt '["0"]' --abi ~/path/to/near-pet-shop/build/contracts/Adoption.json --accountId yourname.testnet

The CLI will output:

```shell script
Scheduling a call inside evm EVM:
0xAdf11a39283CEB00DEB90a5cE9220F89c6C27E67.adopt()
  with args [ '0' ]
```

Then we can use the `aurora view` command again and see the new results:

```shell script
[
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ newly adopted dog
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C', ⟵ josh.testnet
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0xb948c53cBA274D77e54109061068512e92d1249d', ⟵ mike.testnet
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C', ⟵ josh.testnet
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C', ⟵ josh.testnet
  '0x5d60a489B2f457cB351b0faaBf5f9746d6bd4A8C'  ⟵ josh.testnet
]
```
