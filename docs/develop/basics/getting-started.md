Here's a quick overview of essential resources you will use when developing on NEAR.

| Name                                                   | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[NEAR Examples](https://near.dev)**                  | Basic example apps built on NEAR that you can clone and explore.                                         |
| **[NEAR Apps](https://github.com/near-apps)**          | More advanced example apps built on NEAR that showcase functionality.                                        |
| **Tools**                                              |                                                                                                          |
| **[NEAR Wallet](/docs/tools/near-wallet)**             | Create and manage [accounts](/docs/concepts/account) & [access keys](/docs/concepts/account#access-keys) |
| **[NEAR Explorer](/docs/tools/near-explorer)**         | View and inspect [transactions](/docs/concepts/transaction) taking place on the blockchain               |
| **[NEAR CLI](/docs/tools/near-cli)**                   | Command line interface tool to interact with accounts and smart contracts on NEAR                        |

Development on the NEAR platform happens in two main categories:

- **[Applications](/docs/develop/front-end/introduction)** _(front-end)_
- **[Smart contracts](/docs/develop/contracts/overview)** _(back-end)_
