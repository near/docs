> Development on the NEAR platform happens in two main categories:

- **[Smart contracts](/docs/develop/contracts/overview)** _(back-end)_
- **[Applications](/docs/develop/front-end/near-api-js)** _(front-end)_

## Introductory Workshops

> Here are two short introductory workshops _(60-90min)_ for those looking for a more in-depth intro to developing on NEAR.

### NEAR 101

**[ [This workshop](https://bit.ly/near-101) ]** is designed for traditional web 2.0 developers new to creating decentralized applications. _( 90 min )_ Also, If you're new to NEAR or blockchain in general, be sure to check out ["New to NEAR"](/docs/concepts/new-to-near).

### NEAR 102

**[ [This workshop](https://bit.ly/near-102) ]** is designed for Ethereum developers looking to get started developing on NEAR. _( 60 min )_

## CREATE-NEAR-APP

> With [`create-near-app`](https://github.com/near/create-near-app), you can launch a full-stack "Hello World" app in under five minutes! Try it out by running the following in your terminal _(Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))_:

```bash
npx create-near-app your-awesome-project
```

<blockquote class="warning">
<strong>Heads Up!</strong><br><br>

The command above defaults to a Vanilla JavaScript front-end and an [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) smart contract. You can also choose to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for your front end and/or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for your smart contract.

- `--frontend=react` – to use React for your front end template
- `--contract=rust` – to use Rust for your smart contract
