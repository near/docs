## Updating a Node

As a decentralized network, every update to NEAR Protocol needs some coordination between end users, platforms, developers, and validators. [`nearup`](https://github.com/near/nearup) provides scripts to launch NEAR Protocol `testnet` and `betanet` nodes. Unless it is executed with the switch `--binary-path`, `nearup` will automatically update the local binaries if NEAR's boot nodes fork the network and change the genesis checksum.

For security-critical applications and for validators, `nearup` can run a locally compiled binary of [`nearcore`](https://github.com/near/nearcore), but such updates have to be done manually. Since validators are responsible for creating new blocks, coordination in this process is necessary to avoid any network stall.


## Nearcore Planned Updates

NEAR merges node updates from [nearcore releases](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases) following the schedule shown on the public [NEAR Community Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=nearprotocol.com_ltk89omsjnc2ckgbtk6h9157i0@group.calendar.google.com).

Typically, `testnet` and `mainnet` releases are four weeks apart to allow nearcore to be tested thoroughly on `testnet` before promotion to `mainnet`. From time to time, due to changes in engineering calendar and the nature of the release, release dates may change. Please refer to the [NEAR Community Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=nearprotocol.com_ltk89omsjnc2ckgbtk6h9157i0@group.calendar.google.com) for the most updated release dates.
- `testnet` Monday at 15:00 UTC. The release tag is mapped with `x.y.z-rc.1`
- `mainnet` Monday at 15:00 UTC (typically 4 weeks after `testnet` release). The release tag is mapped with `x.y.z`


<blockquote class="warning">
<strong>Heads up</strong><br /><br />

`betanet` provides cutting-edge testing grounds for validators, with daily updates and frequent hard-forks. For more information on nodes that are running on `betanet`, please see the [betanet analysis group on the governance forum](https://gov.near.org/t/betanet-analysis-group-reports/339).

## Nearcore Emergency Updates

We may issue a `[CODE_YELLOW_TESTNET]` or `[CODE_YELLOW_MAINNET]` if the network is suffering minor issues, or a new software release introduces incompatibilities and requires additional testing.

NEAR Protocol team will use the tag `[CODE_RED_TESTNET]` or `[CODE_RED_MAINNET]` in the Validator Announcement channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xsrHaCb), followed by email instructions for coordination. Some updates may follow a confidential process, as explained on [nearcore/SECURITY.md](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/SECURITY.md) docs.

NEAR's team will be mostly active on [Github](https://github.com/near/nearcore), and with limited participation on Discord and Telegram.
