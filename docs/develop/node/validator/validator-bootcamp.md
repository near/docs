## LESSON 1 - OVERVIEW OF NEAR


#### Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a new technology originally developed by Bitcoin. The term most often used to describe blockchain technology is a “public ledger”. An easy way to describe it, is that it’s similar to your banking statement that keeps track of balances, debits, and credits, with several key differences:

- Limitless – Transactions can be added as long as the network is up and running
- Unchangeable – Immutable once written (validated), it can not be modified
- Decentralized – Maintained by individual nodes called validators worldwide
- Verifiable – Transactions are verified via consensus by decentralized validators via a Proof of Stake (POS) or Proof of Work (POW) algorithm

#### Smart Contracts
Not all blockchains are equal. While some only allow the processing of transactions (balances, debits, and credits), blockchains like NEAR and Ethereum offer another layer of functionality that enables programs to run on the blockchain known as smart contracts.

An easy way to think about it is that “smart contract” enabled blockchains are like supercomputers. They allow for users and developers to pay a fee to use CPU/Memory (resources), and Disk (storage) on a global scale.

However, it does not make sense to store everything on the blockchain as it would be too expensive. Web front-ends (HTML, CSS, and JS) are served from web hosting, Github, or Skynet, and images are often stored on InterPlanetary File Systems (IPFS) like Filecoin or Arweave.

#### Sharding
As the founding blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, began to grow, limitations presented themselves. They could only manage to process a specific number of transactions in a block/space of time. This created severe bottlenecks with processing, wait times,  and also significantly increased the transaction fee required to have transactions processed.

Sharding is a technological advancement that allows blockchains to scale and to provide more throughput, while decreasing wait times and keeping transaction fees low. It accomplishes this by creating additional shards as the use of the network grows.

#### About NEAR
NEAR Protocol was designed with a best-of-breed approach in mind. It focuses on fixing the bottlenecks of the earlier blockchains while also enhancing the user experience to enable broader adoption of blockchain technology by existing Web2 users and developers. NEAR is a sharded Proof of Stake (POS) blockchain.

#### Key Features
- Award-Winning Team – Top Programmers in the world
- Proof of Stake (POS)
- Unlimited Shards
- User Experience (UX)
- Developer Experience (DX)
- Rainbow Bridge to ETH – Bridge assets to and from ETH
- Aurora – Run native ETH apps built-in solidity

#### Technology Stack
- Rust – Primary Smart Contract Language
- Assembly Script – Alternant Smart Contract Language (similar to TypeScript)
- NodeJS – Tooling
- Javascript / React / Angular – Frontends

## LESSON 2 - NEAR-CLI
NEAR-CLI is a command-line interface that communicates with the NEAR blockchain via remote procedure calls (RPC):

* Transfer NEAR
* Create/Manage Accounts
* Deploy/Interact Contracts
* View validator Stats
* Setup and Installation

> Note: For security reasons, it is recommended that NEAR-CLI be installed on a different computer than your validator node and that no full access keys be kept on your validator node.


Github Repository: https://github.com/near/near-cli

#### Prerequisites:
Before you start, you might want to ensure your system is up to date.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### Step 1 – Install Node Version 17.x and npm
* Install Nodes.js and NPM:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_17.x | sudo -E bash -  
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs
PATH="$PATH"
```
* Check Node.js and npm version:

```
node -v
```
 > v17.x.x

```
npm -v
```
 > 8.x.x

#### Step 2 – Install near-cli
Once NodeJs and NPM are installed you can now install NEAR-Cli.

Unless you are logged in as root, which is not recommended you will need to use `sudo` to install NEAR-Cli so that the near binary to /usr/local/bin

* Install Near-Cli with this command:

```
sudo npm install -g near-cli
```
### Validator Stats
Now that NEAR-Cli is installed, you can run commands to interact with the blockchain as well as to view validator stats. There are three reports used to monitor validator status:

##### Environment
The environment will need to be set each time a new shell is launched to select the correct network.

Networks:

TestNet
GuildNet
MainNet
Command:

```
export NEAR_ENV=<network> (use testnet / guildnet / mainnet)
```
##### Proposals
A proposal by a validator indicates they would like to enter the validator set, in order for a proposal to be accepted it must meet the minimum seat price.

Command:

```
near proposals
```
##### Validators Current
Shows a list of active validators in the current epoch, the number of blocks produced, number of blocks expected, and online rate. Used to monitor if a validator is having issues.

Command:

```
near validators current
```
##### Validators Next
Show validators whose proposal was accepted one epoch ago, and that will enter the validator set in the next epoch.

Command:

```
near validators next
```

## LESSON 3 - SETUP UP A VALIDATOR
In this lesson you will learn about:
* genesis.json
* config.json
* Setting up a Node
* Difference between MainNet and TestNet
* Compiling NEARCore for MainNet

### Server Requirements


|         | CHUNK ONLY PRODUCER         | BLOCK PRODUCER                                                  |

+---------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

#### Genesis
The genesis.json file is a snapshot of the network state at a point in time. In contacts accounts, balances, active validators, and other information about the network. On MainNet it is the state of what the network looked like at launch. On testnet networks, it can include a more intermediate state if the network was hard-forked at one point.

#### Config
The config.json contains needed information for a node to run on the network, how to communicate with peers, and how to reach consensus. Although some options are configurable in general validators have opted to use the default config.json provided.

### Setup using NEARUp (TestNet/GuildNet)
#### Setup & Installation
NearUp allows for easy setup and configuration of a validator node. It is the easiest way to get up and running on a TestNet network. However, it is not recommended or supported for MainNet.


If you didn't do it before :


  Before you start, you might want to ensure your system is up to date.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### Step 1 – Install Node Version 17.x and npm
* Install Nodes.js and NPM:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_17.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs
PATH="$PATH"
```
* Check Node.js and npm version:

```
node -v
```
 >v17.x.x

```
npm -v
```
 >8.x.x

#### Step 2 – Install near-cli
Once NodeJs and NPM are installed you can now install NEAR-Cli.

Unless you are logged in as root, which is not recommended you will need to use sudo to install NEAR-Cli so that the near binary to /usr/local/bin

```
sudo npm install -g near-cli
```

#### Step 3 – Install required software & set the configuration
* Install Python:

```
apt install python3-pip
```
* Install NearUp:

```
pip3 install --user nearup
```
* Install latest NearUp Version:

```
pip3 install --user --upgrade nearup
```
* Set the configuration:

```
USER_BASE_BIN=$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin
export PATH="$USER_BASE_BIN:$PATH"
```

#### Step 4 – Create a wallet
TestNet: https://wallet.testnet.near.org/

GuildNet: https://wallet.openshards.io/

#### Step 5 – Authorize Wallet Locally
A full access key needs to be installed locally to be able transactions via NEAR-Cli.


For Guildnet
```
export NEAR_ENV=guildnet
```

* You need to run this command:

```
near login
```

> Note: This command launches a web browser allowing for the authorization of a full access key to be copied locally.

1 – Copy the link in your browser

<!-- ![](../../../Downloads/1.png) -->

2 – Grant Access to Near CLI

<!-- ![](../../../Downloads/3.png) -->

3 – After Grant, you will see a page like this, go back to console

<!-- ![](../../../Downloads/4.png) -->

4 – Enter your wallet and press Enter

<!-- ![](../../../Downloads/5.png) -->

#### Step 6 – Start NearUp
NearUp will download the necessary binaries and files to get up and running quickly. You just need to provide the network to run and the staking pool id.

For Guildnet


* Download the latest genesis and config files:

```
cd ~/.near/guildnet
wget -c https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/build.openshards.io/nearcore-deploy/guildnet/config.json
wget -c https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/build.openshards.io/nearcore-deploy/guildnet/genesis.json
```
* Launch this command so set the Near guildnet Environment:


```
export NEAR_ENV=guildnet
```
You can also run this command to set the Near guildnet Environment persistant:
```
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=guildnet' >> ~/.bashrc
```

* Running command is:

```
nearup run $NEAR_ENV --account-id <staking pool id>
```
Where AccountId is xx.stake.guildnet, xx is your pool name for example bootcamp.stake.guildnet


For Testnet

* Download the latest genesis, config files:

```
cd ~/.near/testnet
wget -c https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/testnet/config.json
wget -c https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/testnet/genesis.json
```

* Download the latest snapshot:

```
mkdir ~/.near/testnet/data
cd ~/.near/testnet
wget -c https://near-protocol-public.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/backups/testnet/rpc/data.tar -O - | tar -xf -
```

* Launch this command so set the Near testnet Environment:

```
export NEAR_ENV=testnet
```
* You can also run this command to set the Near testnet Environment persistant:

```
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=testnet' >> ~/.bashrc
```
* Running command is:

```
nearup run $NEAR_ENV --account-id <staking pool id>
```
Where AccountId is xx.pool.f863973.m0, xx is your pool name for example bootcamp.pool.f863973.m0

On the first run, NEARUp will ask you to enter a staking-pool id, provide the staking pool id set up previously in the form {pool id}.{staking pool factory}

> **Note: This is the Chicken and the Egg.\
> You have not created the staking pool, but need to provide the name.**

#### Step 7 – Check the validator_key.json
* Run the following command:

For Guildnet

  ```
  cat ~/.near/guildnet/validator_key.json
  ```

For Testnet
  ```
  cat ~/.near/testnet/validator_key.json
  ```



> Note: If a validator_key.json is not present, follow these steps to create one

Create a validator_key.json for Guildnet

*   Generate the Key file:

```
near generate-key <pool id>
```
* Copy the file generated to Guildnet folder:

Make sure to replace YOUR_WALLET by your accountId
```
cp ~/.near-credentials/guildnet/<YOUR_WALLET>.json ~/.near/guildnet/validator_key.json
```
* Edit “account_id” => xx.stake.guildnet\
  Where xx is your PoolName

* Change “private_key” to “secret_key”

> Note: The account_id must match the staking pool contract name or you will not be able to sign blocks.\
> File content must be something like :
> {
>   "account_id": "xx.stake.guildnet",
>   "public_key": "ed25519:HeaBJ3xLgvZacQWmEctTeUqyfSU4SDEnEwckWxd92W2G",
>   "secret_key": "ed25519:****"
> }


Create a validator_key.json for Testnet

*   Generate the Key file:

```
near generate-key <pool id>
```
* Copy the file generated to Testnet folder:\
Make sure to replace YOUR_WALLET by your accountId
```
cp ~/.near-credentials/testnet/YOUR_WALLET.json ~/.near/testnet/validator_key.json
```
* Edit “account_id” => xx.pool.f863973.m0\
Where xx is your PoolName
* Change “private_key” to “secret_key”

> Note: The account_id must match the staking pool contract name or you will not be able to sign blocks.\
> File content must be something like :
> {
>   "account_id": "xx.pool.f863973.m0",
>   "public_key": "ed25519:HeaBJ3xLgvZacQWmEctTeUqyfSU4SDEnEwckWxd92W2G",
>   "secret_key": "ed25519:****"
> }




#### Step 8 – Check all files were generated

 Command for Guildnet

  ```
  ls ~/.near/guildnet
  ```

Command for Testnet

  ```
  ls ~/.near/testnet
  ```


You should have: **validator_key.json  node_key.json  config.json  data  genesis.json**

### Becoming a Validator
In order to become a validator and enter the validator set, a minimum set of success criteria must be met.

* The node must be fully synced
* The validator_key.json must be in place
* The contract must be initialized with the public_key in validtor_key.json
* The account_id must be set to the staking pool contract id
* There must be enough delegations to meet the minimum seat price
* A proposal must be submitted by pinging the contract
* Once a proposal is accepted a validator must wait 2-3 epoch to enter the validator set
* Once in the validator set the validator must produce great than 90% of assigned blocks

Check running status of validator node. If “V/” is showing up, your pool is selected in the current validators list.

### Submitting Pool Information (MainNet Only)
Adding pool information helps delegators and also helps with outreach for upgrades and other important announcements

https://github.com/zavodil/near-pool-details

Fields and Country Codes: https://github.com/zavodil/near-pool-details/blob/master/FIELDS.md

Command:

```
near call name.near update_field '{"pool_id": "<pool_id>.poolv1.near", "name": "url", "value": "https://yoururl.com"}' --accountId=<accountId>.near  --gas=200000000000000
```
```
near call name.near update_field '{"pool_id": "<pool_id>.poolv1.near", "name": "twitter", "value": "<twitter>"}' --accountId=<account id>.near  --gas=200000000000000
```
```
near view  name.near get_all_fields '{"from_index": 0, "limit": 3}'
```
```
near view  name.near get_fields_by_pool '{"pool_id": "<pool_id>.poolv1.near"}'
```

## LESSON 4 - STAKING POOLS
NEAR uses a staking pool factory with a whitelisted staking contract to ensure delegators’ funds are safe. In order to run a validator on NEAR a staking pool must be deployed to a NEAR account and integrated into a NEAR validator node. Delegators must use a UI or the command line to stake to the pool. A staking pool is a smart contract that is deployed to a NEAR account.

### Deploy a Staking Pool Contract
#### Deploy a Staking Pool
Calls the staking pool factory, creates a new staking pool with the specified name, and deploys it to the indicated accountId.

For Guildnet
```
near call stake.guildnet create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "<pool id>", "owner_id": "<accountId>", "stake_public_key": "<public key>", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId="<accountId>" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
```

For Testnet
```
near call pool.f863973.m0 create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "<pool id>", "owner_id": "<accountId>", "stake_public_key": "<public key>", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId="<accountId>" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
```

For Mainnet
```
near call poolv1.near create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "<pool id>", "owner_id": "<accountId>", "stake_public_key": "<public key>", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId="<accountId>" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
```

From the example above, you need to replace:

* **Pool ID**: Staking pool name, the factory automatically adds its name to this parameter, creating {pool_id}.{staking_pool_factory}
Examples:   

`nearkat.stake.guildnet` for guildnet
`nearkat.pool.f863973.m0` for testnet
`nearkat.poolv1.near` for mainnet

* **Owner ID**: The NEAR account that will manage the staking pool. Usually your main NEAR account.
* **Public Key**: The public key in your **validator_key.json** file.
* **5**: The fee the pool will charge (in this case 5 over 100 is 5% of fees)
* **Account Id**: The NEAR account deploying the staking pool.

> Be sure to have at least 35 NEAR available, it is the minimum required for storage


You will see something like this :\
<!-- ![](../../../Downloads/pool.png)\ -->
If there is a “True” at the End. Your pool is created.

**You have now configure your Staking pool.**

For Guildnet & Testnet
You can go to OSA Discord to ask for some token to be a validator
https://discord.gg/GrBqK3ZJ2T

#### Configure your staking pool contract
Replace:

* Pool Name – pool_id.staking_pool_factory
* Owner Id
* Public Key
* Reward Fraction
* Account Id
```
near call <pool name> new '{"owner_id": "<owner id>", "<public key>": "<public key>", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": <reward fraction>, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId <accountId>
```
#### Manage your staking pool contract
> HINT: Copy/Paste everything after this line into a text editor and use search and replace
> Once your pool is deployed, you can issue the commands below


##### Retrieve the owner ID of the staking pool

Command:

```
near view {pool_id}.{staking_pool_factory} get_owner_id '{}'
```
##### Issue this command to retrieve the public key the network has for your validator
Command:

```
near view {pool_id}.{staking_pool_factory} get_staking_key '{}'
```
##### If the public key does not match you can update the staking key like this (replace the pubkey below with the key in your validator.json file)

```
near call {pool_id}.{staking_pool_factory} update_staking_key '{"stake_public_key": "<public key>"}' --accountId <accountId>
```

## Working with Staking Pools
> NOTE: Your validator must be fully synced before issuing a proposal or depositing funds.

### Proposals

In order to get a validator seat you must first submit a proposal with an appropriate amount of stake. Proposals are sent for epoch +2. Meaning if you send a proposal now, if approved, you would get the seat in 3 epochs. You should submit a proposal every epoch to ensure your seat. To send a proposal we use the ping command. A proposal is also sent if a stake or unstake command is sent to the staking pool contract.

Networks:
* TestNet
* Guildnet
* MainNet

Staking Pools Factories:
* **GuildNet**: stake.guildnet
* **TestNet**: pool.f863973.m0
* **MainNet**: poolv1.near

### Transactions
#### Deposit and Stake NEAR.

Command:
```
near call <staking_pool_id> deposit_and_stake --amount <amount> --accountId <accountId> --gas=300000000000000
```
#### Unstake
Amount in yoctoNEAR.

Run the following command to unstake:
```
near call <staking_pool_id> unstake '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId <accountId> --gas=300000000000000
```
To unstake all you can run this one:
```
near call <staking_pool_id> unstake_all --accountId <accountId> --gas=300000000000000
```
#### Withdraw

Unstaking takes 2-3 epochs to complete, after that period you can withdraw in YoctoNEAR from pool.

Command:
```
near call <staking_pool_id> withdraw '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId <accountId> --gas=300000000000000
```
Command to withdraw all:
```
near call <staking_pool_id> withdraw_all --accountId <accountId> --gas=300000000000000
```

#### Ping
A ping issues a new proposal and updates the staking balances for your delegators. A ping should be issued each epoch to keep reported rewards current.

Command:
```
near call <staking_pool_id> ping '{}' --accountId <accountId> --gas=300000000000000
```
Balances
Total Balance
Command:
```
near view <staking_pool_id> get_account_total_balance '{"account_id": "<accountId>"}' --gas=300000000000000
```
#### Staked Balance
Command:
```

## LESSON 5 - MONITORING
### Log Files
The log file is stored either in the ~/.nearup/logs directory or in systemd depending on your setup.

NEARUp Command:
```
nearup logs --follow
```

Systemd Command:
```
journalctl -n 100 -f -u neard | ccze -A
```

**Log file sample:**
```
INFO stats: #46199418 3 mSo7HtqLU8s5k8GGLRcKtD4kopUV681jNKvgX5bQeaz V/59 30/26/40 peers ⬇ 213.5kiB/s ⬆ 772.9kiB/s 1.00 bps 25.72 Tgas/s CPU: 177%, Mem: 8.6 GiB
```

* **V** (Validator): A “V” will indicate you are an active validator
* **30 Peers**: You need at least 3 peers to reach consensus and start validating
* **#46199418**: Blocks – Look to ensure blocks are moving

### RPC
Any node within the network offers RPC services on port 3030 as long as the port is open in the nodes firewall. The NEAR-CLI uses RPC calls behind the scenes. Common uses for RPC are to check on validator stats, node version and to see delegator stake, although it can be used to interact with the blockchain, accounts and contracts overall.

Find many commands and how to use them in more detail here:

https://docs.near.org/docs/api/rpc



Command:
```
sudo apt install curl jq
```
##### Common Commands:
###### Check your node version:
Command:
```
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3030/status | jq .version
```
###### Check Delegators and Stake
Command:
```
near view <your pool>.stake.guildnet get_accounts '{"from_index": 0, "limit": 10}' --accountId <accountId>.guildnet
```
###### Check Reason Validator Kicked
Command:
```
curl -s -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "validators", "id": "dontcare", "params": [null]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://rpc.openshards.io | jq -c ".result.prev_epoch_kickout[] | select(.account_id | contains ("<POOL_ID>"))" | jq .reason
```
###### Check Blocks Produced / Expected
Command:
```
curl -s -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "validators", "id": "dontcare", "params": [null]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:3030/ | jq -c ".result.current_validators[] | select(.account_id | contains ("POOL_ID"))"

## LESSON 6 - TROUBLESHOOTING
In this lesson you will learn about:

* Keys
* Logs
* Common Errors

### Keys
NEAR uses cryptographic keys to secure accounts and validators, each key has a public and matching private key pair.

Find more detailed information about NEAR and keys:
https://docs.near.org/docs/videos/accounts-keys#docsNav

#### Validator Keys:
To manage and sign transactions a node_key and validator_key.

##### Node Key:

Used to communicate with other peers and is primarily responsible for syncing the blockchain.
```
~/.near/<network>/node_key.json
```
Common Issue:

In a failure situation, both the node_key and validator_key must be copied over

##### Validator Key:

Used to sign and validate blocks.
```
~/.near/<network>/validator_key.json
```
Common Issues:

1. The validator key used to initialize the staking contract is not the one listed in validator_key.json
2. The account Id submitted when NEARUp was initialized is not the same as the one in validator_key.json

#### Logs
##### Common Errors & Solutions
###### Submitting a proposal before the validator is synced
A validator must be fully synced before submitting a proposal to enter the validator set. If you are not fully synced and you entered the validator set your log will be filled with errors.

**Resolution**
Wait until 4 epochs until you have been kicked from the validator set. Delete the data directory and resync. Be sure to be fully synced before staking actions or pings go to your pool.
```
1. Stop the node
2. rm -Rf ~/.near/<NETWORK_ID>/data
3. Start the node
```
###### Starting the node when another instance is running
On occasion, a process will get disconnected from the shell or NEARUp. The common error seen when trying to start the node will be:
```
Err value: Os { code: 98, kind: AddrInUse, message: "Address already in use" }',
```
**Resolution**
Find the pid of the running process
```
ps -elf | grep neard
```
Kill the hung pid
```
kill -9 <PID>
```
###### Running out of Disk space
If you find no space left on device errors in the validator log files then you likely ran out of disk space.
```
1. Stop the node
2. Failover to a backup node
3. Cleanup files or resize disk
4. Fail back over.
```
###### Not enough stake to obtain a validator seat
You can check that your validator proposal was accepted by checking
```
near proposals
```
###### Not producing blocks
Your validator is producing zero blocks in near validators current.

This is due the staking pool contract and the validator_key.json have different public keys or the account_id in validator_key.json not being the staking pool contract id.

**Get the staking pool key**
```
near view <POOL_ID> get_staking_key '{}'
```
**Get the key in validator_key.json**
```
cat ~/.near/<network>/validator_key.json | grep public_key
```
> Note: Both keys must match. If they do not update the staking pool key and wait 2 epochs before pinging.

**Update staking pool key**
```
near call <POOL_ID> update_staking_key '{"stake_public_key": "<PUBLIC_KEY>"}' --accountId <ACCOUNT_ID>
```
**Check the account_id is set to the staking pool contract**
```
vi ~/.near/<network>/validator_key.json
```
```
"account_id" = <staking pool id>
```
> Note: if it does now match the staking pool id upate it and restart your node.

###### Not producing enough blocks or chunks
Missing blocks or chunks is the primary reason a validator is kicked from the validator pool. You can check the number of blocks expected/missed via NEAR-Cli and RPC.

**NEAR-CLI**

```
near validators current | grep <pool id>
```
**RPC**
```
curl -s -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "validators", "id": "dontcare", "params": [null]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:3030/ | jq -c ".result.current_validators[] | select(.account_id | contains ("<POOL_ID>"))"
```
**Check the reason kicked**
```
curl -s -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "validators", "id": "dontcare", "params": [null]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://rpc.openshards.io | jq -c ".result.prev_epoch_kickout[] | select(.account_id | contains ("<POOL_ID>"))" | jq .reason
```
###### Not exporting the correct environment
Be sure that you are using the correct environment each time you run NEAR-Cli

```
export NEAR_ENV=<mainnet,testnet,guildnet>
```
###### Incompatible CPU without AVX support
One cause of missed blocks and nodes falling out of sync is running on a CPU without AVX support. AVX support is required, but not always used depending on the complexity of the transaction.

###### Not running on SSD drives
NEAR Requires a 1 second block time and HDD disks are just not fast enough. SDD drives are required and SSD NVME drives are recommended.

###### Inconsistent Internet connection
NEAR requires a 1 second block time, so any latency from your internet provider can cause you to miss blocks.

###### Inability to gain enough peers for consensus
If you are unable to gain any peers a restart can help. In some rare cases the boot_nodes in config.json can be empty.

Logs like that :
```
INFO stats: #42376888 Waiting for peers 0/0/40 peers ⬇ 0 B/s ⬆ 0 B/s 0.00 bps 0 gas/s CPU: 2%, Mem: 91.3 MiB
```

**Resolution**
Download the latest config.json file and restart.

For Guildnet

  ```
  https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/build.openshards.io/nearcore-deploy/guildnet/config.json
  ```

For Testnet

  ```
 https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/testnet/config.json
  ```

For Mainnet

  ```
  https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/mainnet/config.json
  ```


## NODE FAILOVER
It is an unspoken requirement to maintain a secondary node in a different location in the event of a hardware or network failure on your primary node.

You will need to set up a standard node (without a validator key) and a different node_key. The node will be set up using the normal process see Setup a Validator Node.

Note: The backup node must `track the shard` the same shard in the <strong>config.json</strong> as the primary to be used as a failover node.

```
"tracked_shards":[0],
```
### Failing Over
To failover you must copy the node_key.json and the validatory_key.json to the secondary node and restart.
```
1. Copy over node_key.json
2. Copy over validator_key.json
4. Stop the node primary node
3. Stop the secondary node
4. Restart the secondary node
```
When failing back over to the primary simply move the secondary node_key.json into place and restart the services in reverse order.
