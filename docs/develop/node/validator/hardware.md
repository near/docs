This page covers the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for engaging with the NEAR platform as a validator node.

## Recommended Hardware Specifications

| Hardware       |  Recommended Specifications                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU            | 4-Core (8-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support  |
| RAM            | 16GB DDR4                                                       |
| Storage        | 200GB SSD (HDD will be enough for localnet only)                |

_Verify AVX support on Linux by issuing the command ```$ lscpu | grep -oh  avx```. If the output is empty, your CPU is not supported._


## Minimal Hardware Specifications

| Hardware       |  Minimal Specifications                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU            | 2-Core (4-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support  |
| RAM            | 8GB DDR4                                                        |
| Storage        | 150GB SSD (HDD will be enough for localnet only)                |

_Verify AVX support on Linux by issuing the command ```$ lscpu | grep -oh  avx```. If the output is empty, your CPU is not supported._

## Cost Estimation

Estimated monthly costs depending on operating system:

| Cloud Provider | Machine Size    | Linux                  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| AWS            | c5.2xlarge      | $250 CPU + $20 storage |
| GCP            | c2-standard-8   | $220 CPU + $20 storage |
| Azure          | Standard_F8s_v2 | $180 CPU + $10 storage |
