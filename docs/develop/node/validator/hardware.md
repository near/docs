This page covers the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for engaging with the NEAR platform as a validator node.


## Recommended Hardware Specifications {#recommended-hardware-specifications}

| Hardware       |  Recommended Specifications                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------              |
| CPU            | x86_64 (Intel, AMD) processor with at least 8 physical cores                 |
| CPU Features   | CMPXCHG16B, POPCNT, SSE4.2, AVX                                              |
| RAM            | 16GB DDR4                                                                    |
| Storage        | 250GB SSD (NVMe SSD is recommended. HDD will be enough for localnet only)    |

Verify CPU feature support by running the following command on Linux:

```
lscpu | grep -P '(?=.*avx )(?=.*sse4.2 )(?=.*cx16 )(?=.*popcnt )' > /dev/null \
  && echo "Supported" \
  || echo "Not supported"
```

## Minimal Hardware Specifications {#minimal-hardware-specifications}

| Hardware       |  Minimal Specifications                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------             |
| CPU            | x86_64 (Intel, AMD) processor with at least 8 physical cores                |
| CPU Features   | CMPXCHG16B, POPCNT, SSE4.2, AVX                                             |
| RAM            | 8GB DDR4                                                                    |
| Storage        | 250GB SSD (NVMe SSD is recommended. HDD will be enough for localnet only)   |

Verify CPU feature support by running the following command on Linux:

```
lscpu | grep -P '(?=.*avx )(?=.*sse4.2 )(?=.*cx16 )(?=.*popcnt )' > /dev/null \
  && echo "Supported" \
  || echo "Not supported"
```

## Cost Estimation {#cost-estimation}

Estimated monthly costs depending on operating system:

| Cloud Provider | Machine Size    | Linux                  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| AWS            | c5.2xlarge      | $250 CPU + $20 storage |
| GCP            | c2-standard-8   | $220 CPU + $20 storage |
| Azure          | Standard_F8s_v2 | $180 CPU + $10 storage |
