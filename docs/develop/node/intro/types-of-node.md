You can run three different types of node - Validator Node, RPC Node, and Archival Node.

### Validator Node
Validator nodes are the operators of the NEAR blockchain and are essential to the health of the network. Validator nodes participate in the consensus and produce blocks and/or chunks. You can see a real-time view of NEAR network validator nodes on the [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/nodes/validators).

### RPC Node
RPC nodes are RPC service providers that provide public RPC endpoints for developers to use. The NEAR Foundation currently maintains a public RPC endpoint `http://rpc.mainnet.near.org/` that is free for everyone to use. However, any participants are encouraged to run their own RPC node and offer RPC services through [a grant from the NEAR Foundation](https://near.org/grants/). For more information, please check out Community section in the documentation and reach out in the Validator Channels on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZMPr3VB) and on [Telegram](https://t.me/near_validators).

### Archival Node
Archival nodes store full blockchain data, and build an archive of historical states. These nodes are useful for block explorers, chain analysis, and infrastructure providers.
