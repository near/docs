The RPC API allows you to communicate directly with the NEAR network. For example,
tools such as [near-api](../../tools/near-api.md) are just abstractions making RPC calls.

## RPC Providers

There are multiple [RPC providers which you can choose from](./providers.md). These providers will work as intermediaries to help you interact with the NEAR network.

## Node Snapshots

⚠️ **FREE SNAPSHOT SERVICE BY FASTNEAR WILL BE DEPRECATGED STARTING JUNE 1ST, 2025. We strongly recommend all node operators to use [Epoch Sync](https://near-nodes.io/intro/node-epoch-sync) when possible.**

If you're looking for node snapshots  in order to set up a validator node or RPC, you can download the latest NEAR blockchain state from:

- [Allnodes](https://www.publicnode.com/snapshots#near)
- [FastNEAR](https://docs.fastnear.com/docs/snapshots)
