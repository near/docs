JavaScript is the most popular programming language, used by nearly 14 million developers worldwide. You can write smart-contracts in JavaScript or Typescript, and our SDK will pack them with a lightweight runtime. This can then be compiled into a single Wasm file that can be deployed into the NEAR network.

:::caution
 
This SDK is currently in **[`Alpha`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js/releases/)**. 
 
The JavaScript runtime has not been fully audited. For creating smart contracts that hold value please use [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs).
