## Framework agnostic

[React](https://reactjs.org/) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) variations of the [Guest Book](https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book-js/) dApp can be found in the [`examples`](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector/tree/main/examples) directory. Developers can use these to gain a concrete understanding of how to integrate NEAR Wallet Selector into their own dApp.

### Unlocking the wallet ecosystem

Wallet Selector makes it easy for users to interact with dApps by providing an abstraction over various wallets and wallet types within the NEAR ecosystem.
