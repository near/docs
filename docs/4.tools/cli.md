The NEAR [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs) (CLI) is a tool that enables to interact with the NEAR network directly from the shell. Among other things, the NEAR CLI enables you to:

- Login with a NEAR account
- Deploy a contract
- Interact and query information from a deployed contract

## Configuration file
The directory with access keys and available connection networks are defined in the configuration file (`near-cli/config.toml`), which is located depending on the operating system in the following places:

- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support` (e.g. `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support`)
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME/.config` (e.g. `/home/alice/.config`)
- Windows: `{FOLDERID*RoamingAppData}` (e.g. `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming`)

You can learn more about working with the configuration file [here](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/blob/main/docs/GUIDE.en.md#config---manage-connections-in-a-configuration-file).


:::tip Custom RPC
You can setup a custom [RPC server](../api/rpc/providers) by changing the `rpc_url` parameter in `near-cli` settings:

```bash
near config edit-connection testnet --key rpc_url --value https://archival-rpc.testnet.near.org/
```
