The NEAR SDK is a library that allow to develop smart contracts. Currently, there exist two versions of NEAR SDK: one for Rust and one for JavaScript.

## Smart Contracts on NEAR


This is how a smart contract written in Rust and JavaScript using the NEAR SDK looks like:

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

    ```js
    @NearBindgen({})
    class HelloNear {
      greeting: string = 'Hello';

      @view({}) // This method is read-only and can be called for free
      get_greeting(): string {
        return this.greeting;
      }

      @call({}) // This method changes the state, for which it cost gas
      set_greeting({ greeting }: { greeting: string }): void {
        near.log(`Saving greeting ${greeting}`);
        this.greeting = greeting;
      }
    }
    
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

    ```rust
    #[near(contract_state)]
    pub struct Contract {
        greeting: String,
    }

    impl Default for Contract {
        fn default() -> Self {
            Self { greeting: "Hello".to_string(), }
        }
    }

    #[near]
    impl Contract {
        pub fn get_greeting(&self) -> String {
            self.greeting.clone()
        }

        pub fn set_greeting(&mut self, greeting: String) {
            self.greeting = greeting;
        }
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
