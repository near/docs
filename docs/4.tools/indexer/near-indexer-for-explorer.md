# NEAR Indexer for Explorer

:::

## Description

NEAR Indexer for Explorer is an indexer built on top of [NEAR Indexer microframework](./near-indexer-framework). It watches the network and stores all the data from the blockchain in the PostgreSQL database.

This project serves the needs of [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/) (it's obvious from the project name though).

Both testnet and mainnet have active instances that fill a PostgreSQL database with all the data from the network starting from the genesis as [Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/) requires.

## Shared read-only access to the databases

The main purpose of the indexer is to serve as a data source for [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.near.org/), [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org), and some other internal Pagoda services. Despite this, it also proved itself useful to the general public, so we are giving a shared read-only public access to the data:

:::note NOTE

Please, keep in mind that access to the database is shared across everyone worldwide, so please make sure your queries are efficient and limited.
