A fast RPC for the NEAR blockchain, based on [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [LMDB](https://www.symas.com/lmdb).

## About FastNEAR

[Fast-Near](https://github.com/fastnear/fast-near) aims to provide the fastest RPC implementation for NEAR Protocol using high-performance storage backends:
 - in-memory storage in Redis.
 - SSD optimized storage using LMDB.

It is optimized for `view` call performance and ease of deploy and scaling. 


:::info Note about data sync
FastNear doesn't sync with the NEAR blockchain on its own. Data needs to be loaded either from [NEAR Lake](https://github.com/near/near-lake-indexer) or from [Near State Indexer](https://github.com/vgrichina/near-state-indexer).
