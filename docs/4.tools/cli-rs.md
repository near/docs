# NEAR-CLI-RS

## Quick Start Guide

The `near-cli-rs` tool is a human-friendly companion that helps you interact with the [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/) from the command line. This has a guided prompt interface to help you make your own commands built in Rust.

:::info note

This is a separate tool from [near-cli](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli), a CLI tool of similar functionality without the guided prompts.

:::

## Install

Download the pre-compiled version of `near-cli-rs` for your OS from [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/releases/) or install it with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (Rust's package manager tool) with the following command:

```
$ cargo install near-cli-rs
```

## Getting Started

To utilize the commands that involve transactions, sending tokens, deploying contracts, etc., you'll have to store a full access key to a given account on your machine.

Run...

```
near-cli
```

Using the arrow keys navigate to...

```
account  -Manage accounts
```

Navigate to...

```
import-account -Import existing account (a.k.a. "sign-in")
```

choose any of the preferred sign-in methods. For this example, we'll choose the...

```
using-web-wallet -Import existing account using NEAR Wallet (a.k.a. "sign in")
### Account
- Gives you information on a specified account, near balance, storage, list of access keys, etc.
```

For this tutorial select `testnet`

```
What is the name of the network?
mainnet
>testnet
shardnet
```

You'll get redirected to `wallet.testnet.near.org`. Once there, grant authorization. Then in your terminal, you'll be asked to enter your account ID. Give it the name of the account you just authorized access to and a full access key.

If you're on Mac you'll have the option to use the [Mac Keychain](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac) option.

Either storage option is fine. Using the legacy storage option will save a file in your root directory in a hidden folder called `./near-credentials`. This storage option is compatable with the `near-cli` tool (a cli tool without the guided prompts but similar functionality).

**Good Job!**
Now you can use `near-cli-rs` to it's full capacity.

## Usage

To use the `near-cli-rs` simply run the following in your terminal.

```bash
$ near-cli
```

You should then see the following. Use the arrow keys and hit `enter` or simply type out one of the available options to select an option
