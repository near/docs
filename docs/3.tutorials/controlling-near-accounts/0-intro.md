title: Controlling a NEAR account
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

Imagine acting on behalf of another Near account - without ever holding its private key. Sounds futuristic? It’s possible today, thanks to [Chain Abstraction and Multi-Party Computation (MPC)](../../chain-abstraction/what-is.md#chain-signatures), and this tutorial will walk you step-by-step through the entire process of transferring 0.1 NEAR on behalf of another Near account.

## How It Works

Behind the scenes, a smart contract constructs a valid transaction on behalf of a user and forwards it to an MPC contract for signing.

The key advantage of this approach is that no single entity possesses the private key — ensuring enhanced security and decentralization.

The complete source code for the smart contract used in this tutorial, along with scripts for playground simulation, is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nearuaguild/control-near-account-with-mpc-example).

The contract is rolled out on testnet at `broken-rock.testnet`, feel free to use it for your own purposes if you don't want to dig deeper into deploying it on your own.

## What You Will Learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- [Prepare Near account](1-setup.mdx) to be fully controlled via MPC
- [Build a transfer transaction and get it signed](2-transfer.md) in a smart contract
- [Broadcast a signed transaction](2-transfer.md) into the network over RPC.
