Our counter example is a friendly decentralized app that stores a number and exposes methods to `increment`,
`decrement`, and `reset` it.

## Obtaining the Counter Example

You have two options to start the Counter Example.

1. You can use the app through `GitHub Codespaces`, which will open a web-based interactive environment.
2. Clone the repository locally and use it from your computer.

| Codespaces                                                                                                             | Clone locally                                  |

## Structure of the Example

The example is divided in two main components:

1. The smart contract, available in two flavors: Rust and JavaScript
2. The frontend, that interacts with an already deployed contract.

```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Frontend

The counter example includes a frontend interface designed to interact seamlessly with an existing smart contract that has been deployed. This interface allows users to increase or decrease the counter as needed.

<hr class="subsection" />

### Running the Frontend

To start the frontend you will need to install the dependencies and start the server.

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```

Go ahead and login with your NEAR account. If you don't have one, you will be able to create one in the moment. Once logged in, use the `+` and `-` buttons to increase and decrease the counter. Then, use the Gameboy buttons to reset it and make the counter blink an eye!

### Understanding the Frontend

The frontend is a [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) project generated by [create-near-app](https://github.com/near/create-near-app). Check `_app.js` and `index.js` to understand how components are displayed and interacting with the contract.

  <Github fname="index.js"
          url="https://github.com/near-examples/counters/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/index.js"/>
</Language>

---

## Smart Contract

The contract presents 4 methods: `get_num`, `increment`, `decrement`, and `reset`. The method `get_num` retrieves the current value, and the rest modify it.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="ts">
    <Github fname="contract.ts"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/counters/blob/main/contract-ts/src/contract.ts"
            start="3" end="29" />
  </Language>
  <Language value="rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/counters/blob/main/contract-rs/src/lib.rs"
            start="5" end="37" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

---

### Testing the Contract

The contract readily includes a set of unit and sandbox testing to validate its functionality. To execute the tests, run the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

```bash
cd contract-ts
yarn
yarn test
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">
  
  ```bash
  cd contract-rs
  cargo test
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip
The `integration tests` use a sandbox to create NEAR users and simulate interactions with the contract.
:::

<hr class="subsection" />

### Deploying the Contract to the NEAR network

In order to deploy the contract you will need to create a NEAR account.

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

```bash
# Optional - create an account
near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet

# Deploy the contract
cd contract-ts
yarn build
near deploy <accountId> ./build/counter.wasm
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

```bash
# Optional - create an account
near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet

# Deploy the contract
cd contract-rs
cargo build
near deploy <accountId> ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/counter.wasm
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
To interact with your contract from the [frontend](#frontend), simply replace the value of the `testnet` key in the `config.js` file.
:::

<hr class="subsection" />

### CLI: Interacting with the Contract

To interact with the contract through the console, you can use the following commands

```bash
# Get the current number of the counter
near view counter.near-examples.testnet get_num

# Increment the counter 
# Replace <accountId> with your account ID
near call counter.near-examples.testnet increment --accountId <accountId>

# Decrement the counter
# Replace <accountId> with your account ID
near call counter.near-examples.testnet decrement --accountId <accountId>

# Reset the counter to zero 
# Replace <accountId> with your account ID
near call counter.near-examples.testnet reset --accountId <accountId>
```

:::tip
If you're using your own account, replace `counter.near-examples.testnet` with your `accountId`.
:::

---

## Moving Forward

A nice way to learn is by trying to expand the contract. Modify it by adding a parameter to `increment` and `decrement`,
so the user can choose by how much to change the value. For this, you will need to use knowledge from the [anatomy](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/anatomy/anatomy.md)
and [storage](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/anatomy/storage.md) sections.

:::note Versioning for this article

At the time of this writing, this example works with the following versions:

- near-cli: `4.0.13`
- node: `18.19.1`
- rustc: `1.77.0`
