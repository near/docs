title: Complex Cross Contract Call
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import {CodeTabs, Language, Github} from "@site/components/codetabs"

This example presents 3 instances of complex cross-contract calls. Particularly, it shows:
1. How to batch multiple method calls to a same contract.
2. How to call multiple contracts in parallel, each returning a different type.
3. Different ways of handling the responses in the callback.

---

## Batch Actions

You can aggregate multiple actions directed towards one same contract into a batched transaction.
Methods called this way are executed sequentially, with the added benefit that, if one fails then
they **all get reverted**.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="ðŸ¦€ Rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/xcc-advanced/blob/main/contract/src/batch_actions.rs"
            start="7" end="19" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting the Last Response
In this case, the callback has access to the value returned by the **last
action** from the chain.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="ðŸ¦€ Rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/xcc-advanced/blob/main/contract/src/batch_actions.rs"
            start="21" end="34" />
  </Language>

## Calling Multiple Contracts

A contract can call multiple other contracts. This creates multiple transactions that execute
all in parallel. If one of them fails the rest **ARE NOT REVERTED**.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="ðŸ¦€ Rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/xcc-advanced/blob/main/contract/src/multiple_contracts.rs"
            start="18" end="56" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting All Responses
In this case, the callback has access to an **array of responses**, which have either the
value returned by each call, or an error message.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="ðŸ¦€ Rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/xcc-advanced/blob/main/contract/src/multiple_contracts.rs"
            start="58" end="91" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

## Multiple Calls - Same Result Type 

This example is a particular case of the previous one ([2. Calling Multiple Contracts](#2-calling-multiple-contracts)).
It simply showcases a different way to check the results by directly accessing the `promise_result` array.

In this case, we call multiple contracts that will return the same type:

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="ðŸ¦€ Rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/xcc-advanced/blob/main/contract/src/similar_contracts.rs"
            start="18" end="31" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting All Responses
In this case, the callback again has access to an **array of responses**, which we can iterate checking the
results.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="ðŸ¦€ Rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="lib.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/xcc-advanced/blob/main/contract/src/similar_contracts.rs"
            start="33" end="61" />
  </Language>
