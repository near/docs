title: Complex Cross Contract Call
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import {CodeTabs, Language, Github} from "@site/src/components/codetabs"

This example presents 3 instances of complex cross-contract calls. Particularly, it shows:

1. How to batch multiple function calls to a same contract.
2. How to call multiple contracts in parallel, each returning a different type.
3. Different ways of handling the responses in the callback.

## Obtaining the Cross Contract Call Example

You have two options to start the Donation Example:

1. You can use the app through `Github Codespaces`, which will open a web-based interactive environment.
2. Clone the repository locally and use it from your computer.

## Smart Contract

### Batch Actions

You can aggregate multiple actions directed towards one same contract into a batched transaction.
Methods called this way are executed sequentially, with the added benefit that, if one fails then
they **all get reverted**.

          start="38" end="41" />
    <Github fname="batch_actions.ts"
          url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/batch_actions.ts"

            start="8" end="20" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting the Last Response

In this case, the callback has access to the value returned by the **last
action** from the chain.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
    <Github fname="contract.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/contract.ts"

            start="22" end="35" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

### Calling Multiple Contracts

A contract can call multiple other contracts. This creates multiple transactions that execute
all in parallel. If one of them fails the rest **ARE NOT REVERTED**.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
    <Github fname="contract.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/contract.ts"
      start="48" end="51" />
    <Github fname="multiple_contracts.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/multiple_contracts.ts"
      start="6" end="21" />
  </Language>
  <Language value="rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="multiple_contracts.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-rs/src/multiple_contracts.rs"
            start="16" end="55" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting All Responses

In this case, the callback has access to an **array of responses**, which have either the
value returned by each call, or an error message.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
    <Github fname="contract.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/contract.ts"
      start="53" end="58" />
    <Github fname="multiple_contracts.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/multiple_contracts.ts"
      start="24" end="41" />
    <Github fname="utils.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/utils.ts"
      start="3" end="20" />
  </Language>
  <Language value="rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="multiple_contracts.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-rs/src/multiple_contracts.rs"
            start="58" end="92" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

### Multiple Calls - Same Result Type

This example is a particular case of the previous one ([Calling Multiple Contracts](#2-calling-multiple-contracts)).
It simply showcases a different way to check the results by directly accessing the `promise_result` array.

In this case, we call multiple contracts that will return the same type:

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
    <Github fname="contract.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/contract.ts"
      start="65" end="70" />
    <Github fname="similar_contracts.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/similar_contracts.ts"
      start="6" end="35" />
  </Language>
  <Language value="rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="similar_contracts.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-rs/src/similar_contracts.rs"
            start="8" end="31" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting All Responses

In this case, the callback again has access to an **array of responses**, which we can iterate checking the
results.

<CodeTabs>
  <Language value="js" language="js">
    <Github fname="contract.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/contract.ts"
      start="62" end="65" />
    <Github fname="similar_contracts.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/similar_contracts.ts"
      start="37" end="54" />
    <Github fname="utils.ts"
      url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-ts/src/internal/utils.ts"
      start="3" end="20" />
  </Language>
  <Language value="rust" language="rust">
    <Github fname="similar_contracts.rs"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-advanced-rs/src/similar_contracts.rs"
            start="32" end="57" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

### Testing the Contract

The contract readily includes a set of unit and sandbox testing to validate its functionality. To execute the tests, run the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

  ```bash
  cd contract-advanced-ts
  yarn
  yarn test
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">
  
  ```bash
  cd contract-advanced-rs
  cargo test
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip
The `integration tests` use a sandbox to create NEAR users and simulate interactions with the contract.
:::

<hr class="subsection" />

### Deploying the Contract to the NEAR network

In order to deploy the contract you will need to create a NEAR account.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  # Create a new account pre-funded by a faucet
  near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

  ```bash
  # Create a new account pre-funded by a faucet
  near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service <my-new-dev-account>.testnet autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Go into the directory containing the smart contract (`cd contract-advanced-ts` or `cd contract-advanced-rs`), build and deploy it:

```bash
cargo near build

cargo near deploy <accountId> with-init-call new json-args '{"hello_account":"hello.near-example.testnet","guestbook_account":"guestbook_account.near-example.testnet","counter_account":"counter_account.near-example.testnet"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### CLI: Interacting with the Contract

To interact with the contract through the console, you can use the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">
  
  ```bash
  # Execute contracts sequentially
  # Replace <accountId> with your account ID
  near call <accountId> batch_actions --accountId <accountId> --gas 300000000000000   

  # Execute contracts in parallel
  # Replace <accountId> with your account ID
  near call <accountId>  multiple_contracts --accountId <accountId> --gas 300000000000000   

  # Execute multiple instances of the same contract in parallel
  # Replace <accountId> with your account ID
  near call <accountId> similar_contracts --accountId <accountId> --gas 300000000000000
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">
  
  ```bash
  # Execute contracts sequentially
  # Replace <accountId> with your account ID
  near contract call-function as-transaction <accountId> batch_actions json-args '{}' prepaid-gas '300.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <accountId> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send

  # Execute contracts in parallel
  # Replace <accountId> with your account ID
  near contract call-function as-transaction <accountId> multiple_contracts json-args '{}' prepaid-gas '300.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <accountId> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send

  # Execute multiple instances of the same contract in parallel
  # Replace <accountId> with your account ID
  near contract call-function as-transaction <accountId> similar_contracts json-args '{}' prepaid-gas '300.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <accountId> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::info
If at some point you get an "Exceeded the prepaid gas" error, try to increase the gas amount used within the functions when calling other contracts
