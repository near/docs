title: Cross Contract Call

This example performs the simplest cross-contract call possible: it calls our [Hello NEAR](hello-near.md) example to set and retrieve a greeting.
It is one of the simplest examples on making a cross-contract call, and the perfect gateway to the world of interoperative contracts.

## Obtaining the Cross Contract Call Example

You have two options to start the project:

1. You can use the app through `Github Codespaces`, which will open a web-based interactive environment.
2. Clone the repository locally and use it from your computer.

## Structure of the Example

The smart contract is available in two flavors: Rust and JavaScript

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="🌐 JavaScript">

```bash
┌── sandbox-ts # sandbox testing
│    ├── hello-near
│    │    └── hello-near.wasm
│    └── main.ava.ts
├── src # contract's code
│    └── contract.ts
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="🦀 Rust">

```bash
┌── tests # sandbox testing
│    ├── hello-near
│    │    └── hello-near.wasm
│    └── tests.rs
├── src # contract's code

## Smart Contract

### Contract
The contract exposes methods to query the greeting and change it. These methods do nothing but calling `get_greeting` and
`set_greeting` in the `hello-near` example.

            start="17" end="39" />

            url="https://github.com/near-examples/cross-contract-calls/blob/main/contract-simple-rs/src/external.rs" />
  </Language>
</CodeTabs>

### Testing the Contract

The contract readily includes a set of unit and sandbox testing to validate its functionality. To execute the tests, run the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="🌐 JavaScript">

```bash
cd contract-simple-ts
yarn
yarn test
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="🦀 Rust">
  
  ```bash
  cd contract-simple-rs
  cargo test
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip
The `integration tests` use a sandbox to create NEAR users and simulate interactions with the contract.
:::

In this project in particular, the integration tests first deploy the `hello-near` contract. Then,
they test that the cross-contract call correctly sets and retrieves the message. You will find the integration tests
in `sandbox-ts/` for the JavaScript version and in `tests/` for the Rust version.

### Deploying the Contract to the NEAR network

In order to deploy the contract you will need to [create a NEAR account](/develop/contracts/quickstart#create-a-testnet-account).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="🌐 JavaScript">

```bash
# Optional - create an account
near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet

# Deploy the contract
cd contract-simple-ts
yarn build
near deploy <accountId> ./build/cross_contract.wasm init --initFunction init --initArgs '{"hello_account":"hello.near-example.testnet"}'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="🦀 Rust">

```bash
# Optional - create an account
near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet

# Deploy the contract
cd contract-simple-rs

cargo near build

# During deploying pass {"hello_account":"hello.near-example.testnet"} as init arguments
cargo near deploy <accountId>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr class="subsection" />

### CLI: Interacting with the Contract

To interact with the contract through the console, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Get message from the hello-near contract
# Replace <accountId> with your account ID
near call <accountId> query_greeting --accountId <accountId>

# Set a new message for the hello-near contract
# Replace <accountId> with your account ID
near call <accountId> change_greeting '{"new_greeting":"XCC Hi"}' --accountId <accountId>
```

## Moving Forward

A nice way to learn is by trying to expand a contract. Modify the cross contract example to use the [guest-book](guest-book.md)
contract!. In this way, you can try to make a cross-contract call that attaches money. Remember to correctly [handle the callback](../../2.develop/contracts/crosscontract.md#callback-method),
and to return the money to the user in case of error.

### Advanced Cross Contract Calls

Your contract can perform multiple cross-contract calls in simultaneous, creating promises that execute in parallel, or as a batch transaction. Check the [advanced cross contract calls
tutorial](./advanced-xcc) to learn more.
