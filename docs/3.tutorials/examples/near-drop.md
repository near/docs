A near-drop is a smart contract that allows users to create NEAR/FT/NFT drop and claim created drops by another user using a PublicKey.

Particularly, it shows:

1. How to calculate storage costs
2. How to create a NEAR drop.
3. How to create a FT drop.
4. How to create a NFT drop.
5. How to claim a drop for an existing account.
6. How to claim a drop for a new account.

### Contract State

- `top_level_account` - that account is used to create new accounts. It has to have `create_account` method.
- `next_drop_id` - that id will be assigned to the next created drop.
- `drop_id_by_key` - that LookupMap structure contains relations between `PublicKey` and `DropId`. `PublicKey` is used to claim drop. `DropId` is a unique identificator by which you can get drop's data like amount of tokens to drop, FT or NFT contract, etc.
- `drop_by_id` - that LookupMap structure contains relations between `DropId` and actual drop data - `Drop`.

### Drop Types

There are 3 types of drops, which differ in what the user will receive when he claims the corresponding drop - NEAR, fungible tokens (FTs) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

### Create a drop

Creating drop functions looks very similar, the main difference is in the structures used to store the drop data.

### Claim a drop

In order to claim drop claiming methods have to be called by near-drop contract and signed with a corresponding `PublicKey`. There are two ways to claim a drop: claim for an existing account and claim for a new account. In last case claimer account will be created.

When a drop is claimed, its `counter` decreases by 1 and corresponding relation between `PublicKey` and `DropId` removing from the contract state (`drop_id_by_key` collection).

When all drops are claimed (`counter` == 0), relation between `DropId` and `Drop` removing from the `drop_by_id` collection as well.

### Testing the Contract

The contract readily includes a sandbox testing to validate its functionality. To execute the tests, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rust" label="ðŸ¦€ Rust">
  
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The `integration tests` use a sandbox to create NEAR users and simulate interactions with the contract.
:::

---

### Deploying the Contract to the NEAR network

In order to deploy the contract you will need to create a NEAR account.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  # Create a new account pre-funded by a faucet
  near create-account <accountId> --useFaucet
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

  ```bash
  # Create a new account pre-funded by a faucet
  near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service <my-new-dev-account>.testnet autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then build and deploy the contract:

```bash
cargo near build

cargo near deploy <accountId> with-init-call new json-args '{"top_level_account": "testnet"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### CLI: Interacting with the Contract

To interact with the contract through the console, you can use the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">

  ```bash
