A factory is a smart contract that stores a compiled contract on itself, and automatizes deploying it into
sub-accounts.

We have two factory examples:
1. [**Token Factory**](https://github.com/near-examples/token-factory): A factory that creates [fungible tokens](../fts/0-intro.md) contracts. 
2. [**A Generic Factory**](https://github.com/near-examples/factory-rust): A factory that creates [donation contracts](./donation.md), but allows to change the contract it deploys.

In this page we will focus on the Donation factory, to learn more about the token factory visit its repository.

## Generic Factory
The [Generic Factory](https://github.com/near-examples/factory-rust/) presents a contract factory that:
1. Creates sub-accounts of itself and deploys its contract on them (`create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy`).
2. Can change the stored contract using the `update_stored_contract` method.

## Quickstart

1. Make sure you have installed [rust](https://rust.org/).
2. Install the [`NEAR CLI`](https://github.com/near/near-cli#setup)

<hr class="subsection" />

### Build and Deploy the Factory
You can automatically compile and deploy the contract in the NEAR testnet by running:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

Once finished, check the `neardev/dev-account` file to find the address in which the contract was deployed:

```bash
cat ./neardev/dev-account
# e.g. dev-1659899566943-21539992274727
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### Deploy the Stored Contract Into a Sub-Account

`create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy` will create a sub-account of the factory and deploy the
stored contract on it.

```bash
near call <factory-account> create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy '{ "name": "sub", "beneficiary": "<account-to-be-beneficiary>"}' --deposit 1.24 --accountId <account-id> --gas 300000000000000
```

This will create the `sub.<factory-account>`, which will have a `donation` contract deployed on it:

```bash
near view sub.<factory-account> get_beneficiary
# expected response is: <account-to-be-beneficiary>
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### Update the Stored Contract
`update_stored_contract` enables to change the compiled contract that the factory stores.

The method is interesting because it has no declared parameters, and yet it takes
an input: the new contract to store as a stream of bytes.

To use it, we need to transform the contract we want to store into its `base64`
representation, and pass the result as input to the method:

```bash
# Use near-cli to update stored contract
export BYTES=`cat ./src/to/new-contract/contract.wasm | base64`
near call <factory-account> update_stored_contract "$BYTES" --base64 --accountId <factory-account> --gas 30000000000000
```

> This works because the arguments of a call can be either a `JSON` object or a `String Buffer`

## Factories - Concepts & Limitations

Factories are an interesting concept, here we further explain some of their implementation aspects,
as well as their limitations.  

<hr class="subsection" />

### Automatically Creating Accounts
NEAR accounts can only create sub-accounts of itself, therefore, the `factory` can only create and
deploy contracts on its own sub-accounts. 

This means that the factory:
1. **Can** create `sub.factory.testnet` and deploy a contract on it.
2. **Cannot** create sub-accounts of the `predecessor`.
3. **Can** create new accounts (e.g. `account.testnet`), but **cannot** deploy contracts on them.

It is important to remember that, while `factory.testnet` can create `sub.factory.testnet`, it has
no control over it after its creation.

<hr class="subsection" />


### The Update Method

The `update_stored_contracts` has a very short implementation:

```rust
#[private]
pub fn update_stored_contract(&mut self) {
  self.code = env::input().expect("Error: No input").to_vec();
}
```

On first sight it looks like the method takes no input parameters, but we can see that its only
line of code reads from `env::input()`. What is happening here is that `update_stored_contract`
**bypasses** the step of **deserializing the input**. 

You could implement `update_stored_contract(&mut self, new_code: Vec<u8>)`,
which takes the compiled code to store as a `Vec<u8>`, but that would trigger the contract to:
1. Deserialize the `new_code` variable from the input.
2. Sanitize it, making sure it is correctly built.

When dealing with big streams of input data (as is the compiled `wasm` file to be stored), this process
of deserializing/checking the input ends up **consuming the whole GAS** for the transaction.
