title: NFT Zero to Hero JavaScript Edition
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

> In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
> You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.


:::caution
 
The JS-SDK is currently in **[`Alpha`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js/releases/)**. 
 
The JavaScript runtime has not been fully audited. For creating smart contracts that hold value please use [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs).
