> In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
> You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Node.js](/develop/prerequisites#nodejs)
- [A NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/create)
- [NEAR-CLI](/tools/near-cli#setup)

| 4    | [Upgrade a contract](/tutorials/nfts/js/upgrade-contract)        | Discover the process to upgrade an existing smart contract.                          |
| 5    | [Enumeration](/tutorials/nfts/js/enumeration)                    | Explore enumeration methods that can be used to return the smart contract's states.  |
| 6    | [Core](/tutorials/nfts/js/core)                                  | Extend the NFT contract using the core standard which allows token transfer          |
