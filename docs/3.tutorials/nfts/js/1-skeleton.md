> You'll discover the contract's layout and you'll see how the JavaScript files are structured in order to build a feature-complete smart contract.


:::caution

The JS-SDK is currently in **[`Alpha`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js/releases/)**.

## Introduction

This tutorial presents the code skeleton for the NFT smart contract and its file structure.
You'll find how all the functions are laid out as well as the missing JS code that needs to be filled in.
Once every file and function has been covered, you'll go through the process of building the mock-up contract to confirm that everything is working correctly.

## File structure

Following a regular [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) project, the file structure for this smart contract has:

- `package.json` file to define the packages and scripts used in the project.
- `src` folder where all the JavaScript source files are stored
- `build` folder where the compiled `wasm` will output to.

### Source files

## `approval.ts`

> This allows people to approve other accounts to transfer NFTs on their behalf.

This file contains the internal logic that complies with the standard's [approvals management](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/ApprovalManagement.html) extension. Here is a breakdown of the methods and their functions:

| Method              | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **internalNftApprove**     | Approves an account ID to transfer a token on your behalf. Called during **nft_approve**.                                                |
| **internalNftIsApproved** | Checks if the input account has access to approve the token ID. Called during **nft_is_approved**.                                            |
| **internalNftRevoke**      | Revokes a specific account from transferring the token on your behalf. Called during **nft_revoke**.                                     |
| **internalNftRevokeAll**  | Revokes all accounts from transferring the token on your behalf. Called during **nft_revoke_all**.                                         |

```js reference

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **internalNftTransfer**         | Transfers an NFT to a receiver ID. Called during **nft_transfer**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **internalNftTransferCall**    | Transfers an NFT to a receiver and calls a function on the receiver ID's contract. The function returns `true` if the token was transferred from the sender's account. Called during **nft_transfer_call**.                                                                                                                        |
| **internalNftToken**            | Allows users to query for the information about a specific NFT. Called during **nft_token**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                       |
| **internalNftResolveTransfer** | When you start the `nft_transfer_call` and transfer an NFT, the standard dictates that you should also call a method on the receiver's contract. If the receiver needs you to return the NFT to the sender (as per the return value of the `nft_on_transfer` method), this function allows you to execute that logic. Called during **nft_resolve_transfer**. |

```js reference
https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/blob/1.skeleton/src/nft-contract/nft_core.ts#L10-L85

https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/blob/1.skeleton/src/nft-contract/index.ts#L16-L157
```

You'll learn more about these functions in the [minting section](/tutorials/nfts/js/minting) of the tutorial series.

## Building the skeleton

- If you haven't cloned the main repository yet, open a terminal and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/
```

- Next, switch to the `1.skeleton` branch. 
- Install the dependencies (including the JS SDK): `yarn`
- Build the contract with `yarn build`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial-js/
cd nft-tutorial-js
git checkout 1.skeleton
yarn && yarn build
```

Once this finishes, the `nft-tutorial-js/build` directory should contain the `nft.wasm` smart contract!

Building the skeleton is useful to validate that everything works properly and that you'll be able to compile improved versions of this NFT contract in the upcoming tutorials.

---

## Conclusion

You've seen the layout of this NFT smart contract, and how all the functions are laid out across the different source files.
Using `yarn`, you've been able to compile the contract, and you'll start fleshing out this skeleton in the next [Minting tutorial](/tutorials/nfts/js/minting).
