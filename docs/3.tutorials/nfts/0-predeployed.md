Create your first non-fungible token by using a pre-deployed NFT smart contract which works exactly as the one you will build on this tutorial.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial successfully, you'll need [a NEAR Wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/create) and [NEAR CLI](/tools/near-cli#setup)

:::tip
You can install near-cli through the following command:

```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```
:::

## Using the NFT contract

Minting an NFT token on NEAR is a simple process that involves calling a smart contract function.

To interact with the contract you will need to first login to your NEAR account through `near-cli`.

<hr class="subsection" />

### Setup

Log in to your newly created account with `near-cli` by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
near login
```

Set an environment variable for your account ID to make it easy to copy and paste commands from this tutorial:

```bash
export NEARID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME
```

<hr class="subsection" />

### Minting your NFTs

We have already deployed an NFT contract to `nft.examples.testnet` which allows users to freely mint tokens. Let's use it to mint our first token.

Run this command in your terminal, remember to replace the `token_id` with a string of your choice. This string will uniquely identify the token you mint. 

```bash
near call nft.examples.testnet nft_mint '{"token_id": "TYPE_A_UNIQUE_VALUE_HERE", "receiver_id": "'$NEARID'", "metadata": { "title": "GO TEAM", "description": "The Team Goes", "media": "https://bafybeidl4hjbpdr6u6xvlrizwxbrfcyqurzvcnn5xoilmcqbxfbdwrmp5m.ipfs.dweb.link/", "copies": 1}}' --accountId $NEARID --deposit 0.1
```

### Querying your NFT

To view tokens owned by an account you can call the NFT contract with the following `near-cli` command:

```bash
near view nft.examples.testnet nft_tokens_for_owner '{"account_id": "'$NEARID'"}'
```

<details>
<summary>Example response: </summary>
<p>

```json
[
  {
    "token_id": "Goi0CZ",
    "owner_id": "bob.testnet",
    "metadata": {
      "title": "GO TEAM",
      "description": "The Team Goes",
      "media": "https://bafybeidl4hjbpdr6u6xvlrizwxbrfcyqurzvcnn5xoilmcqbxfbdwrmp5m.ipfs.dweb.link/",
      "media_hash": null,
      "copies": 1,
      "issued_at": null,
      "expires_at": null,
      "starts_at": null,
      "updated_at": null,
      "extra": null,
      "reference": null,
      "reference_hash": null
    },
    "approved_account_ids": {}
  }
]
```

**Congratulations!** You just minted your first NFT token on the NEAR blockchain! ðŸŽ‰

Now try going to your [NEAR Wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com) and view your NFT in the "Collectibles" tab.

## Final remarks

This basic example illustrates all the required steps to call an NFT smart contract on NEAR and start minting your own non-fungible tokens.

Now that you're familiar with the process, you can jump to [Contract Architecture](/tutorials/nfts/skeleton) and learn more about the smart contract structure and how you can build your own NFT contract from the ground up.

***Happy minting!*** ðŸª™
