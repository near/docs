title: NFT Zero to Hero
sidebar_label: Introduction

> In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
> You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](/develop/prerequisites)
- [A NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/create)
- [NEAR-CLI](/tools/near-cli#setup)

:::info New to Rust?
If you are new to Rust and want to dive into smart contract development, our [Quick-start guide](/develop/quickstart-guide) is a great place to start.

## Overview

These are the steps that will bring you from **_Zero_** to **_Hero_** in no time! ðŸ’ª

| Step | Name                                                                         | Description                                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | [Pre-deployed contract](/tutorials/nfts/predeployed-contract) | Mint an NFT without the need to code, create, or deploy a smart contract.            |
| 2    | [Contract architecture](/tutorials/nfts/skeleton)             | Learn the basic architecture of the NFT smart contract and compile code.             |
| 3    | [Minting](/tutorials/nfts/minting)                            | Flesh out the skeleton so the smart contract can mint a non-fungible token.          |
| 4    | [Upgrade a contract](/tutorials/nfts/upgrade-contract)        | Discover the process to upgrade an existing smart contract.                          |
| 5    | [Enumeration](/tutorials/nfts/enumeration)                    | Explore enumeration methods that can be used to return the smart contract's states.  |
| 6    | [Core](/tutorials/nfts/core)                                  | Extend the NFT contract using the core standard which allows token transfer          |
| 7    | [Approvals](/tutorials/nfts/approvals)                        | Expand the contract allowing other accounts to transfer NFTs on your behalf.         |
| 8    | [Royalty](/tutorials/nfts/royalty)                            | Add NFT royalties allowing for a set percentage to be paid out to the token creator. |
| 9    | [Marketplace](/tutorials/nfts/marketplace)                            | Learn about how common marketplaces operate on NEAR and dive into some of the code that allows buying and selling NFTs |

<!--
1. [Events](/tutorials/nfts/events): in this tutorial you'll explore the events extension, allowing the contract to react on certain events.
1. [Marketplace](/tutorials/nfts/marketplace): in the last tutorial you'll be exploring some key aspects of the marketplace contract.
