sidebar_label: Introduction

In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [A Testnet wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/create)
- [NEAR-CLI-RS](../../4.tools/cli-rs.md#setup)
- [cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near)

:::info New to Rust?
If you are new to Rust and want to dive into smart contract development, our [Quick-start guide](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/quickstart.md) is a great place to start

| 1    | [Pre-deployed contract](/tutorials/nfts/predeployed-contract) | Mint an NFT without the need to code, create, or deploy a smart contract.                                              |
| 2    | [Contract architecture](/tutorials/nfts/skeleton)             | Learn the basic architecture of the NFT smart contract and compile code.                                               |
| 3    | [Minting](/tutorials/nfts/minting)                            | Flesh out the skeleton so the smart contract can mint a non-fungible token.                                            |
| 4    | [Upgrade a contract](/tutorials/nfts/upgrade-contract)        | Discover the process to upgrade an existing smart contract.                                                            |
| 5    | [Enumeration](/tutorials/nfts/enumeration)                    | Explore enumeration methods that can be used to return the smart contract's states.                                    |
| 6    | [Core](/tutorials/nfts/core)                                  | Extend the NFT contract using the core standard which allows token transfer.                                        |
| 7    | [Events](/tutorials/nfts/events)                              | The events extension, allowing the contract to react on certain events.                                              |
| 8    | [Approvals](/tutorials/nfts/approvals)                        | Expand the contract allowing other accounts to transfer NFTs on your behalf.                                           |
| 9    | [Royalty](/tutorials/nfts/royalty)                            | Add NFT royalties allowing for a set percentage to be paid out to the token creator.                                   |
| 10   | [Marketplace](/tutorials/nfts/marketplace)                    | Learn about how common marketplaces operate on NEAR and dive into some of the code that allows buying and selling NFTs. |
