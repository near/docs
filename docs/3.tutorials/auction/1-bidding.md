In this section of the tutorial, you'll learn how to create a basic auction smart contract from scratch. The contract will allow users to place bids and track the highest bidder.

&nbsp;

## Creating a new project

To get started you'll need to create a new NEAR project.

In your command line run:

```
$ cargo near new auction-contract
```

Enter your new project 

```
$ cd auction-contract
```

Then go ahead and open up a code editor such as VS Code

```
$ code . 
```

Enter src > lib.rs, there already exists an example contract there so we'll just go ahead and delete everything and start from the start!

&nbsp;

## Defining the contract structure 

Smart contracts are simply structures that store data and implement functions to mutate and view that data. First, we'll define what data we are storing. We'll also need some imports along the way.

```rust
use near_sdk::json_types::U64;
use near_sdk::{env, near, require, AccountId, NearToken, PanicOnDefault, Promise};

#[near(serializers = [json, borsh])]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Bid {
    pub bidder: AccountId,
    pub bid: NearToken,
}

#[near(contract_state, serializers = [json, borsh])]
#[derive(PanicOnDefault)]
pub struct Contract {
    highest_bid: Bid,
    auction_end_time: U64,
}
```

Here we define the Contract structure that has fields:
- **highest_bid**: stores the information of the highest bidder in an instance of another struct named Bid.
- **auction_end_time**: specifies the block_timestamp (which will be explained later) at which the auction will end.

Contract also has attributes:
- **contract_state**: enables borsh serialization and decentralization to read and write the structure to the blockchain in binary form and adds NearSchmema **IDK what this does?**
- **serializers**: enables both borsh and JSON serialization and decentralization. The JSON serializer allows for the whole contract state to be outputted in JSON form. Although borsh is already enabled by contract_state, we have to specify it again in serializers if we want to add JSON. 
- **PanicOnDefault**: forces the contract to have custom initialization (we will see this later). 

&nbsp; 

Since highest_bid stores type Bid we have a nested structure. Bid itself has fields:
- **bidder**: specifies the unique human readable NEAR account ID of the bidder.
- **bid**: specifies the bid amount in YoctoNEAR (10^-24 NEAR).

Bid has attributes:
- **serializers**: enables both borsh and JSON serialization and decentralization.
- **Clone**: allows a Bid object to be duplicated.

&nbsp;

## Initializing the contract

Now we have defined the data structures for the contract we next define its methods.

First, we set up an initialization function that will determine the initial state of the contract. As stated earlier this contract only offers custom initialization where the user is required to input parameters. 

```rust 
#[near]
impl Contract {
    #[init]
    #[private] // Only callable by the contract's account
    pub fn init(end_time: U64) -> Self {
        Self {
            highest_bid: Bid {
                bidder: env::current_account_id(),
                bid: NearToken::from_yoctonear(1),
            },
            auction_end_time: end_time,
        }
    }
```

We decorate the implementation of Contract with `near` to  **IDK** . The `init` function has attributes `init` to denote it is an initialization function and `private` to restrict the function to only be called by the account on which the contract is deployed. The function takes the parameter `end_time` which specifies the block_timestamp of when the auction will end.

When this function is called the `auction_end_time` will be set and `highest_bid` will be set with `bidder` as the account on which the the contract is deployed and `bid` as 1 YoctoNEAR (10^-24 NEAR) so that if no one bids no one will win the auction.

&nbsp;

## Placing a bid

An auction isn't an auction if you can't place a bid! We'll now add a method that allows a user to place a bid by attaching NEAR tokens to the method call. The method needs to implement logic, it should check whether the auction is still ongoing, check whether their bid is higher than the previous and if it meets both criteria it should update the `highest_bid` field accordingly and return the funds back to the previous bidder.

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn bid(&mut self) -> Promise {
    // Assert the auction is still ongoing
    require!(
        env::block_timestamp() < self.auction_end_time.into(),
        "Auction has ended"
    );

    // Current bid
    let bid = env::attached_deposit();
    let bidder = env::predecessor_account_id();

    // Last bid
    let Bid {
        bidder: last_bidder,
        bid: last_bid,
    } = self.highest_bid.clone();

    // Check if the deposit is higher than the current bid
    require!(bid > last_bid, "You must place a higher bid");

    // Update the highest bid
    self.highest_bid = Bid { bidder, bid };

    // Transfer tokens back to the last bidder
    Promise::new(last_bidder).transfer(last_bid)
}
```

When the user calls the `bid` method they will transfer NEAR tokens to the contract; to enable the transfer of NEAR tokens we need to decorate the method with the `payable` attribute. This method is what we call a "change method", also known as a "call method"; we know this since it passes a mutable reference to itself ($mut self). Change methods require the user to pay gas and can change the state of the contract.

- First, the method checks that the auction is still ongoing by checking that the current `block_timestamp` is less than the auction end time. `block_timestamp` gives the time as the number of nanoseconds since January 1, 1970, 0:00:00 UTC. Here we use `require` as opposed to `assert` as it reduces the contract size by not including file and rust-specific data in the panic message.

- Next, the method sets the variables `bid` to the attached NEAR deposit in the method call (type NearToken) and `bidder` to the predecessor's account ID (type AccountId). Note that the predecessor is the account (or contract) that directly calls the bid method, this can be different from the signer (env::signer_account_id) who initially signed the transaction leading to the execution of this method. If pivortex.near calls a contract proxy-contract.near which then calls bid on this contract the predecessor would be proxy-contract.near and the signer would be pivortex.near. For security purposes, we stick with predecessor_account_id here.

- Then, the method deconstructs the `highest_bid` into two distinct variables and checks that the last bid was higher than the current bid. If so then the `highest_bid` will be updated to the current bid. 

- The contract then returns a `Promise` that will transfer NEAR of the amount `last_bid` to the `last_bidder`.

&nbsp;

## Viewing the contract state

We also implement "view methods" into this contract; this allows the user to view the data stored on the contract. View methods don't require any gas but cannot change the state of the contract. We know it is a view method since it takes an immutable reference to self (&self). An example use case here is being able to view, in the frontend, what the highest bid amount was so we make sure that we place a higher bet.

```rust
pub fn get_highest_bid(&self) -> Bid {
    self.highest_bid.clone()
}
```

In the repo there are further view methods that follow a very similar structure. 

Congratulations, you just created a basic NEAR smart contract!




Add tests here or all at the end, delete tests folder when creating exmaple?
Add cargo near build, cargo test, near-cli-rs here?
