title: Creating a Frontend
---

Now that we have successfully created a contract, it's time to build a frontend to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with it. Up until now, we have been using the CLI to send transactions and view the contract's state. However, frontends offer a more intuitive way for end users to interact with the contract. They can display all the relevant information in one place, allow users to make calls with a simple button click, and only require a wallet as a prerequisite.

## Frontend structure

Navigate to the auction frontend.

```bash
cd frotends/01-frontend
```

Here we have a simple Next.js frontend that we'll walk through to understand the basics of creating a frontend for a NEAR smart contract.

For starters, let's take a look at how the code in the frontend is structured by doing a quick overview of the important files.

| File                             | Description                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **_app.js**           | Responsible for rending the page, initiates the wallet object and adds it to global context  |
| **index.js**          | The main page where the projects components are loaded into and contains most of the logic for the application like viewing the state of the contract and logic for placing a bid |
| **near.js**           | Contains the wallet class that has methods to interact with the wallet and blockchain |
| **context.js**        | Holds the global context - the wallet object and the signed in account ID - that can be accessed anywhere |
| **config.js**         | Specifies the account ID of the auction contract |
| **Navigation.jsx**    | A component that contains a button to sign users in and out of wallets |
| **Bid.jsx**           | A component allowing a user to make a bid |
| **LastBid.jsx**       | A component that displays the highest bid and when the highest bid will next refresh |
| **AuctionItem.jsx**   | A component that displays information about the NFT being auctioned  |
| **Timer.jsx**         | A component that shows how long till the auction is over, or, if over, displays a button to claim the auction and then states the auction is over
