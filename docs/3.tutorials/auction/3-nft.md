No one will enter an auction if there's nothing to win, so let's add a prize. Why not an [NFT](../../2.build/5.primitives/nft.md)? NFTs are uniquely identifiable, easily swappable and their logic comes from an external contract with audited standards so the prize will exist without the auction contract. Let's get to work!

## Defining the NFT interface


<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">

    <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

    <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

        Since NFTs follow standards, all NFT contracts implement the same interface that sets out the contract's methods, what parameters these methods take and what the method will return. When we are making calls to other contracts we write the interface of each method in a separate file `ext.rs` as a `trait`. 

        <Github fname="ext.rs" language="rust"
                url="https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-rs/03-owner-claims-winner-gets-nft/src/ext.rs"
                start="1" end="10" />

        `nft_transfer` transfers the ownership of an NFT from one account ID to another. The method takes the arguments `receiver_id` dictating who will now own the NFT and the `token_id` specifying which token in the NFT contract is having its ownership transferred. The `ext_contract` macro converts the NFT trait into a module with the method `nft_transfer`.

        Note that we declare `TokenId` in our main file `lib.rs`. The NFT standards use a type alias for future-proofing.

        <Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust"
                url="https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-rs/03-owner-claims-winner-gets-nft/src/lib.rs#L15"
                start="15" end="15" />

        We import our interface into `lib.rs` as such:
        
        <Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust"
                url="https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-rs/03-owner-claims-winner-gets-nft/src/lib.rs#L5-L6"
                start="5" end="6" />

## Listing the NFT

When we create an auction we need to list the NFT. To specify which NFT is being auctioned off we need the account ID of the NFT contract and the token ID of the NFT. We will specify these when the contract is initialized; amend `init` as such:

## Transferring the NFT to the winner

        When the auction is ended - by calling the method `claim` - the NFT needs to be transferred to the highest bidder. We make a cross-contract call to the NFT contract, via the external method we defined, at the end of `claim`.

        <Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust"
                url="https://github.com/near-examples/auctions-tutorial/blob/main/contract-rs/03-owner-claims-winner-gets-nft/src/lib.rs#L94-L97"
                start="94" end="97" />

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

When calling this method we specify the NFT contract name, that we are attaching 30 Tgas to the call, that we are attaching a deposit of 1 YoctoNEAR to the call (since the NFT contract requires this for [security reasons](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/security/one_yocto.md)), and the arguments `reciever_id` and `token_id`.

---

## NFT ownership problems

In our contract, we perform no checks to verify whether the contract actually owns the specified NFT. A bad actor could set up an auction with an NFT that the contract doesn't own causing `nft_transfer` to fail and the winning bidder to lose their bid funds with nothing in return. We could make a cross-contract call to the NFT contract to verify ownership on initialization but this would become quite complex. Instead, we will do this check off-chain and validate the auction in the frontend.

## Updating the tests

Again let's go and update our tests to reflect the changes we've made to our contract.

## Integration tests

In our integration tests, we're now going to be interacting with two contracts; the auction contract and an NFT contract. Integration tests are perfect for testing multiple contracts that interact.

In our tests folder, we need the WASM for an NFT contract. **Add more here**

We deploy the NFT contract WASM using `dev_deploy` which creates an account with a random ID and deploys the contract to it.

To get the NFT to be auctioned, the auction contract calls the NFT contract to mint a new NFT with the provided data.

                start="60" end="76" />

After `claim` is called, the tests should verify that the auction winner now owns the NFT. This is done by calling `nt_token` on the NFT contract and specifying the token ID.

## Conclusion 

This this part of the tutorial we have added NFTs as a reward which has taught us how to interact with NFT standards, make cross-contract calls and test multiple contracts that interact in workspaces. In the [next part](./4-ft.md) we'll learn how to interact with fungible token standards by adapting the auction to receive bids in FTs.
