[`near-examples/near-lake-raw-printer-js`](https://github.com/near-examples/near-lake-raw-printer-js): source code for the tutorial on how to create an indexer that prints block height and number of shards

:::

Recently we have [published a JavaScript version of the NEAR Lake Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/near-lake-framework) on npmjs.org

We want to empower you with a basic tutorial on how to use the JavaScript Library. Let's get started!


## Requirements

Before we get started, please, ensure you have:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

## Create a project

Create an indexer project:

```bash
mkdir near-lake-raw-printer-js && cd near-lake-raw-printer-js
```

Now we're going to call `npm init`, we can continue with the default values pressing Enter on every question in the interactive mode:
```bash
npm init
```

```
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to /Users/near/projects/near-lake-raw-printer-js/package.json:

{
  "name": "near-lake-raw-printer-js",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes)
```

`package.json` is ready. Let's install `near-lake-framework`

## Install dependencies

Install `near-lake-framework`

```bash
npm install near-lake-framework --save
```

Install `typescript` as dev dependency

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

## Setup TypeScript

Now we can create `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript settings:

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

Paste the content to the file:

```json title=tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": [
      "ES2015",
      "dom"
    ]
  }
}
```

Now let's add the `scripts` section to the `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "tsc && node index.js"
}
```

After that your `package.json` should look similar to:

```json title=package.json
{
  "name": "near-lake-raw-printer",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc && node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "near-lake-framework": "^1.0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^4.6.4"
  }
}
```

Now let's create `index.ts`

```bash
touch index.ts
```

Open `index.ts` in your favorite editor to start coding.

## Import `near-lake-framework`

In the `index.ts` file let's import the necessary dependencies:

```ts
import { startStream, types } from 'near-lake-framework';
```

We've imported the main function `startStream` which will be called to actually run the indexer, and `types` that hold the `LakeConfig` type we need to contruct.

## Create a config

To get indexer running we need to start it with a config. We need to create an instance of `LakeConfig`

```ts
const lakeConfig: types.LakeConfig = {
    s3BucketName: "near-lake-data-mainnet",
    s3RegionName: "eu-central-1",
    startBlockHeight: 63804051,
};
```

## Create indexer handler

Indexer will be streaming the [`StreamerMessage`](https://near-indexers.io/docs/data-flow-and-structures/structures/toc) instances we need to handle according to our needs.

In `near-lake-framework` JS library the handler have to be presented as a callback function. This function have to:
- be asynchronous
- accept an argument of type [`StreamerMessage`](https://near-indexers.io/docs/data-flow-and-structures/structures/toc)
- return nothing (`void`)

Creating the callback:

```ts
async function handleStreamerMessage(streamerMessage: types.StreamerMessage): Promise<void> {
    //
}
```

For this tutorial our requirement is to log the block height and the numer of shards. That's simple:

```ts
async function handleStreamerMessage(streamerMessage: types.StreamerMessage): Promise<void> {
    console.log(`
        Block #${streamerMessage.block.header.height}
        Shards: ${streamerMessage.shards.length}
    `);
}
```

## Starting the stream

And the last thing to write is the call to `startStream` with the config and pass the callback function.

```ts
(async () => {
    await startStream(lakeConfig, handleStreamerMessage);
})();
```

That's it. Now we can compile the code and run it

## Compile and run

:::danger Credentials

To be able to access the data from [NEAR Lake](/tools/realtime#near-lake-indexer) you need to provide credentials. Please, see the [Credentials](credentials.md) article

:::

We've added the `start` command to the `scripts`, so the compilation and run should as easy as

```bash
npm run start
```

You should see something like the following:

```bash
Block #63804051 Shards: 4
Block #63804052 Shards: 4
Block #63804053 Shards: 4
Block #63804054 Shards: 4
Block #63804055 Shards: 4
Block #63804056 Shards: 4
Block #63804057 Shards: 4
Block #63804058 Shards: 4
Block #63804059 Shards: 4
Block #63804060 Shards: 4
```

You can stop the indexer by pressing CTRL+C

## What's next?

You can play around and change the content of the callback function [`handleStreamerMessage`](#create-indexer-handler) to handle the data differently.

You can find the [source code for this tutorial on the GitHub](https://github.com/near-examples/near-lake-raw-printer-js).
