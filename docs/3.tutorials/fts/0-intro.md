title: Fungible Tokens Zero to Hero
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials covering every aspect of a fungible token (FT) smart contract. You'll start by interacting with a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll have built a fully-fledged FT smart contract that supports every extension of the standards.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](/build/smart-contracts/quickstart#prerequisites)
- [A NEAR wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com)
- [NEAR-CLI-RS](../../4.tools/cli-rs.md#install)
- [cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near)

:::info New to Rust?
If you are new to Rust and want to dive into smart contract development, our [Quick-start guide](../../2.build/2.smart-contracts/quickstart.md) is a great place to start.

These are the steps that will bring you from **_Zero_** to **_Hero_** in no time! 💪

| Step | Name                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | [Pre-deployed contract](/tutorials/fts/predeployed-contract) | Receive FTs without the need to code, create, or deploy a smart contract.                                                                       |
| 2    | [Contract architecture](/tutorials/fts/skeleton)             | Learn the basic architecture of the FT smart contract and compile the code.                                                                     |
| 3    | [Defining a Token](/tutorials/fts/defining-a-token)          | Flesh out what it means to have a FT and how you can customize your own.                                                                         |
| 4    | [Circulating Supply](/tutorials/fts/circulating-supply)      | Learn how to create an initial supply and have the token show up in your wallet.                                                                |
| 5    | [Registering Accounts](/tutorials/fts/registering-accounts)  | Explore how you can implement and understand the storage management standard to avoid malicious users from draining your funds.                 |
| 6    | [Transferring FTs](/tutorials/fts/transfers)                 | Learn how to transfer FTs and discover some of the true powers that the core standard brings                                                    |
| 7    | [Marketplace](/tutorials/fts/marketplace)                    | Learn about how common marketplaces operate on NEAR and dive into some of the code that allows buying and selling NFTs by using Fungible Tokens. |

<!--
1. [Events](/tutorials/fts/events): in this tutorial you'll explore the events extension, allowing the contract to react on certain events.
1. [Marketplace](/tutorials/fts/marketplace): in the last tutorial you'll be exploring some key aspects of the marketplace contract.
