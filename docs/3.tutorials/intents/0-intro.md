title: Integrate with NEAR Intents
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

NEAR Intents is a powerful protocol designed to simplify and streamline interactions with multichain financial products. It enables users to define high-level financial operations without needing to manage the complexity of smart contract interactions across multiple blockchains.

The protocol abstracts execution details, making it easier for developers
and users to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) operations seamlessly.
For more in-depth details about the architecture behind NEAR Intents and
the multichain bridge OmniBridge, visit the official
[NEAR documentation](/chain-abstraction/intents/overview).

## What You Will Learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- [Deposit tokens](1-deposit.mdx) from different chains (NEAR, EVM-compatible, Solana)
- [Execute a swap](2-swap.mdx) using the NEAR Intents protocol
- [Withdraw funds](3-withdraw.mdx) back to the destination chain if needed (NEAR, EVM-compatible, Solana)
