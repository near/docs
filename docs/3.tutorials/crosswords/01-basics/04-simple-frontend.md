# Add a simple frontend

This will be the final section in this chapter, where we'll add a simple frontend using React and [`near-api-js`](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference) to communicate with the smart contract.

There will be three main files we'll be working with:
1. `src/index.js` will be the entry point, where NEAR network configuration will be set up, and the view-only call to `get_solution` will happen.
2. `src/App.js` is then called and sets up the crossword table and checks to see if a solution has been found.
3. `src/utils.js` is used to make a view-only call to the blockchain to get the solution, and other helper functions.

## Entry point

We'll go over a pattern that may look familiar to folks who have surveyed the [NEAR examples site](https://near.dev). We'll start with an asynchronous JavaScript function that sets up desired logic, then pass that to the React app.

```js reference
https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/3e497b4815600b8382614f76c7812520710f704d/src/index.js#L3-L22
```

Let's talk through the code above, starting with the imports.

We import from:

- `config.js` which, at the moment, is a common pattern. This file contains details on the different networks. (Which RPC endpoint to hit, which NEAR Wallet site to redirect to, which NEAR Explorer as wellâ€¦)
- `utils.js` for that view-only function call that will call `get_solution` to retrieve the correct solution hash when a person has completed the crossword puzzle correctly.
- `hardcoded-data.js` is a file containing info on the crossword puzzle clues. This chapter has covered the crossword puzzle where the solution is **near nomicon ref finance**, and according to the chapter overview we've committed to serving *one* puzzle. We'll improve our smart contract later, allowing for multiple crossword puzzles, but for now it's hardcoded here.

Next, we define an asynchronous function called `initCrossword` that will be called before passing data to the React app. It's often useful to set up a connection with the blockchain here, but in our case all we need to do is retrieve the crossword puzzle solution as a hash. Note that we're attempting to pass this environment variable `NEAR_ENV` into our configuration file. `NEAR_ENV` is used to designate the blockchain network (testnet, betanet, mainnet) and is also [used in NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/develop/deploy). 

Lastly, we'll call `initCrossword` and, when everything is complete, pass data to the React app contained in `App.js`.

## React app

Here's a large portion of the `App.js` file, which will make use of a fork of a React crossword library by Jared Reisinger.

```js reference
https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/3e497b4815600b8382614f76c7812520710f704d/src/App.js#L3-L54
```

We'll discuss a few key points in the code above, but seeing as we're here to focus on a frontend connection to the blockchain, will brush over other parts that are library-specific.

The two imports worth highlighting are:

- `parseSolutionSeedPhrase` from the utility file we'll cover shortly. This will take the solution entered by the user and put it in the correct order according to the rules discussed in [the chapter overview](00-overview.md#how-it-works).
- `sha256` will take the ordered solution from above and hash it. Then we'll compare that hash with the one retrieved from the smart contract.

```js
const [solutionFound, setSolutionFound] = useState(false);
```

We're using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) here, setting up the variable `solutionFound` that will be changed when the player of the crossword puzzle enters the final letter of the crossword puzzle, having entries for all the letters on the board.

The `onCrosswordComplete` and `checkSolution` blocks of code fire events to check the final solution entered by the user, hash it, and compare it to the `solutionHash` that was passed in from the view-only call in `index.js` earlier.

Finally, we return the [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) for our app and render the crossword puzzle! In this basic case we'll change this heading to indicate when the user has completed the puzzle successfully:

```html
<h3>Status: { solutionFound }</h3>
```

## Utility functions

We'll be using two utility functions here:

- `parseSolutionSeedPhrase` which will take a completed crossword puzzle and place the answers in the proper order. (Ascending by number, across answers come before down ones.)
- `viewMethodOnContract` makes the view-only call to the smart contract to retrieve the solution hash.

We'll only focus on the second method:

```js reference
https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/3e497b4815600b8382614f76c7812520710f704d/src/utils.js#L8-L12
```

This API doesn't look warm and friendly yet. You caught us! We'd love some help to improve our API as [detailed in this issue](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/issues/612), but for now, this is a concise way to get data from a view-only method.

We haven't had the frontend call a mutable method for our project yet. We'll get into that in the coming chapters when we'll want to have a prize sent to the first person to solve the puzzle.

## Run the React app

Let's run our frontend on testnet! We won't add any new concepts at this point in the chapter, but note that the [near examples](https://near.dev) typically create an account for you automatically with a NodeJS command. We covered the important pattern of creating a subaccount and deploying the smart contract to it, so let's stick with that pattern as we start up our frontend.

```bash
# Go into the directory containing the Rust smart contract we've been working on
cd contract

# Build (for Windows it's build.bat)
./build.sh

# Create fresh account if you wish, which is good practice
near delete crossword.friend.testnet friend.testnet
near create-account crossword.friend.testnet --masterAccount friend.testnet

# Deploy
near deploy crossword.friend.testnet --wasmFile res/my_crossword.wasm \
  --initFunction 'new' \
  --initArgs '{"solution": "69c2feb084439956193f4c21936025f14a5a5a78979d67ae34762e18a7206a0f"}'
  
# Return to the project root and start the React app
cd ..
env CONTRACT_NAME=crossword.friend.testnet npm run start
```

The last line sends the environment variable `CONTRACT_NAME` into the NodeJS script. This is picked up in the `config.js` file that's used to set up the contract account and network configuration:

```js reference
https://github.com/near-examples/crossword-tutorial-chapter-1/blob/3e497b4815600b8382614f76c7812520710f704d/src/config.js#L1
```

After running the last command to start the React app, you'll be given a link to a local website, like `https://localhost:1234`. When you visit the site you'll see the simple frontend that interacts with our smart contract:
