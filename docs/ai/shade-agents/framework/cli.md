---

The [Shade Agent CLI](https://github.com/NearDeFi/shade-agent-cli/tree/main) abstracts away the complexity of deploying a Shade Agent.

Under the hood the CLI:
- Builds and publishes the Docker Image for your agent app and modifies your environment variables and docker-compose.yaml to match your new image
- Creates the agent contract account, deploys the agent contract to it and initializes it with the ACCOUNT_ID as the owner
- Approves the image code hashes for your agent (app and API image)
- Deploys the agent to a TEE on Phala Cloud

---

## Local vs Production

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_contractId` in your environment variables prefix should be set to `ac-proxy.` for local development and `ac-sandbox.` for TEE deployment.

For local deployment the CLI works a little differently:
- No Docker Image is built or published for your agent app
- An agent contract that doesn't require agent registration is deployed instead (since locally you cannot produce a valid TEE attestation)
- The API image is hosted locally instead of deploying anything to a TEE

---

## Installation 

```bash
npm i -g @neardefi/shade-agent-cli
```

---

## Usage

The Shade Agent CLI is a single command with standard configurations. Run the command within the root of your project.

```bash
shade-agent-cli
```

Your project root must contain your `.env.development.local`, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` files.

---

## Flags 

The CLI comes with a list of flags to configure the CLI and switch part off. If you need further customizability when deploying your agent we suggest you switch off the relevant part via a flag and complete that step manually using native tools - [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/), [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) and [Phala CLI](https://docs.phala.network/phala-cloud/phala-cloud-cli/overview)


- **--wasm `<path>`** 

  Path to a custom agent contract WASM file (e.g. `contract/near/contract.wasm`) to deploy instead of the default contract. Use this when using [custom contracts](../custom-agent-contract.md). 

- **--funding `<amount>`** 

  Amount of NEAR tokens to fund the contract deployment (e.g. `5` for 5 NEAR). Use this when deploying a custom contract.

- **--image** 

  Build and push the Docker image only. Use this when you want customizability over the deployment of the agent contract.

- **--contract**

  Build and push the Docker image, and deploy the contract only. Use this when you want customizability over the approving of image code hashes.

- **--phala-only**

  Deploy the agent, specified by the currentÂ `docker-compose.yaml`, to Phala Cloud. Use this when you want to redeploy the same agent as you last deployed.

- **--no-redeploy**

  Skip redeploying the contract. Use when you want to deploy a new agent quicker and you don't need the agent contract redeploying.

- **--no-build**

  Skip building and pushing the Docker image. Use this when you want to redeploy the same agent or want more control over the image build process.

- **--no-phala**

  Skip deploying the agent to Phala Cloud. Use this when you want more control over hosting the agent (e.g. deploying to a TEE with higher specs).

- **--no-cache**

  Run docker build with --no-cache. Use this when you need clean builds or want to update cached layers (e.g. cached layers may use older packages). 

:::note
Some options are mutually exclusive. See error messages for details if you use conflicting flags.

## Custom RPC

To use the non default RPC with the CLI and the API create a filed named `near-rpc.json` with your projects root and configure the RPCs you would like to use, for example:

```json
{
  "nearRpcProviders": [
    {
      "connectionInfo": {
        "url": "https://neart.lava.build:443"
      },
      "options": {
        "retries": 3,
        "backoff": 2,
        "wait": 1000
      }
    },
    {
      "connectionInfo": {
        "url": "https://test.rpc.fastnear.com"
      },
      "options": {
        "retries": 3,
        "backoff": 2,
        "wait": 1000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If required, you can specify headers under connectionInfo.
