# Verifiable AI DAO

In this tutorial, you'll explore how to build a `fully verifiable AI DAO` using the Shade Agent Framework. The Verifiable AI DAO is a DAO smart contract that uses a Shade Agent with a verifiable LLM to vote on governance proposals according to its predefined manifesto, to create transparent, AI-driven governance that is decentralized and auditable from end-to-end.

This tutorial also serves as a `template` for building `yield and resume-based Shade Agents`. This is a smart contract that, when called, halts its execution for the verified agent to complete some logic and resume the transaction when it has a result, enabled by NEAR's asynchronous design. This pattern allows the agent and LLM become a part of the contract, enabling smart contracts with extended capabilities of a backend server that can make API calls and use LLM inference. This is especially useful when making cross-contract calls to smart contracts that use yield and resume, allowing you to receive the result in the callback - for example, an on-demand oracle.

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial demonstrates how key components of the Shade Agent Framework work together with NEAR's broader tech stack to create a product that is `decentralized and verifiable throughout the entire stack`. The tutorial covers:
- **NEAR-native Shade Agent**: How to develop a Shade Agent that operates exclusively on the NEAR blockchain
- **Yield and Resume Pattern**: Building a Shade Agent that uses the yield and resume pattern
- **Verifiable AI Integration**: Implementing a Shade Agent that uses NEAR AI's verifiable/private inference
