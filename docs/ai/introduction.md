Building AI agents that control accounts and assets on all blockchains has never been easier. NEAR enables AI agents to transact on any chain, while
our **Shade Agent Framework** allows to create verifiable and trustless AI agents with multi-chain capabilities out of the box.

## Let Your Agent use NEAR

AI Agents can easily control account and assets on all blockchains thanks to NEARs unique features. You simply need to give them access to a NEAR account and they can start interacting with smart contracts, sending transactions, and managing assets everywhere.

Check our [NEAR MCP](./near-mcp.md) documentation to get started.

## Build Trustless Multi-Chain Agents

The [Shade Agent Framework](./shade-agents/getting-started/introduction.md) enables to build **verifiable** **multi-chain AI agents**. These agents operate in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and leverage NEAR features such as multi-key management and Chain Signatures to securely manage assets and sign transactions across multiple blockchains.

Shade agents can autonomously sign transactions on any chain, interact with AI models and external data sources, and perform privacy-preserving, verifiable computations.

## Common Questions

### Can Trustless Agents lose access to their wallets?
Not with Shade Agents. They use decentralized key management—any instance of the agent with the same code can access the same accounts.

### Do I need to know blockchain development?
Our tools and resources help to abstract away the complexity of blockchain development.

### What chains can my agent interact with?
NEAR accounts allow to transact on all chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana thanks to Chain Signatures.
