Chain Signatures unlock the ability for a single account to transact across multiple blockchain protocols, giving ownership of cross-chain accounts, data, and assets to one NEAR account.

In this document we cover the steps necessary to sign a transaction for another chain, we recommend you to read our [**overview of Chain Signatures**](../1.concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures.md) before, as well as some of its [**use cases**](../1.concepts/abstraction/signatures/use-case.md).

## Create the Payload
The first step is to use Chain Signatures is to construct a payload (transaction, message, data, etc.) for the target blockchain platform. This variates depending on the target blockchain, but in general, it's a hash of the message or transaction to be signed.

      start="12" end="33" />
  </TabItem>

  console.log("Coming soon...")
  ```
  </TabItem>

## Request & Reconstruct a Signature 
Once a payload is created and ready to sign, a signature request is made by calling `sign` on the [MPC smart contract](../1.concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures.md#2-signature-request). 

The method expects the `payload` to be signed for the target blockchain, and a `path` representing the account that should be used to sign the payload (learn more [here](../1.concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures.md#2-signature-request)).

      start="24" end="33" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="₿ Bitcoin">

    ```js
    console.log("Coming soon...")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The contract will take some time to respond, as it needs to wait for the [`MPC signing service`](../1.concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures.md#3-mpc-signing-service). Once finished, the result will not be the signature on itself, but the elements needed to reconstruct the signature.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="₿ Bitcoin">

    ```js
    console.log("Coming soon...")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Relaying the Signature

Once we have reconstructed the signature, we can relay it to the corresponding network. This will once again vary depending on the target blockchain.

      start="36" end="40" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="₿ Bitcoin">

    ```js
    console.log("Coming soon...")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
