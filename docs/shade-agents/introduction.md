# What are Shade Agents?

Shade Agents are the first verifiable, non-custodial, multichain AI agents with no single point of failure. 

Shade Agents are:
- **AI Powered**\
Verifiably access LLMs. 

- **Multichain**\
Can custody any crypto asset and sign transactions on any chain.

- **Non-custodial**\
No one entity controls the private keys of the agent (MPC signing). 

- **Verifiable**\
Agent code is known and executes as expected; no one can tamper with the agent.

- **Confidential**\
Inputs and state of the agent can be private. 

- **Flexible**\
Interact with off-chain data and APIs beyond blockchain VM limits.

- **Low cost**\
Run intensive computation cheaply without gas limits (~20% TEE overhead compared to standard servers).
