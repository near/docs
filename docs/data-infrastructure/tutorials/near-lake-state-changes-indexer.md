This tutorial will guide you through building a simple indexer using the NEAR Lake Framework. The indexer will listen for `StateChange` events and print relevant data about account changes.

[`near-examples/near-lake-accounts-watcher`](https://github.com/near-examples/near-lake-accounts-watcher/tree/0.2.0): source code for a video tutorial on how to use the NEAR Lake Framework

:::

:::info Version 0.2.0

The video is based on the [`near-lake-framework`](/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake-framework) version 0.2.0

At the same time we're keeping the source code up to date with the latest version of the published crate.

We've created a video tutorial to empower the release announcement of [NEAR Lake Framework](/data-infrastructure/lake-framework/near-lake-framework).

In this tutorial you will build an indexer application to watch for any `StateChange`s affecting the account or a list of account provided.
