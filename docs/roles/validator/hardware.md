## Machine Specifications

- **CPU:** 4-Core (8-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent with AVX support
- **RAM:** 16GB DDR4
- **Storage:** 100GB SSD

_Verify AVX support on Linux by issuing the command ```$ lscpu | grep -oh  avx```. If the output is empty, your CPU is not supported._

Estimated monthly costs depending on operating system:

| Cloud Provider | Machine Size    | Linux                  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| AWS            | c5.2xlarge      | $150 CPU + $20 storage |
| GCP            | c2-standard-8   | $250 CPU + $20 storage |
| Azure          | Standard_F8s_v2 | $180 CPU + $10 storage |
