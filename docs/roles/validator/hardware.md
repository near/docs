This page covers the minimum and recommended hardware requirements for engaging with the NEAR platform as an application developer, validator, integrator or core contributor.

## Machine Specifications

### Validator

- **CPU:** 2-Core (4-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon equivalent
- **RAM:** 8GB DDR4
- **Storage:** 100GB SSD (__Note: HDD will not work__)

Estimated monthly costs depending on operating system:

| Cloud Provider | Machine Size    | Linux                 |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| AWS            | c5.large        | $40 CPU + $20 storage |
| GCP            | n1-standard-2   | $50 CPU + $20 storage |
| Azure          | Standard_F2s_v2 | $45 CPU + $10 storage |

### Track all shards

Currently, if you want to ensure full security immediately after the finality gadget is done, the easiest way is to run a node that tracks all shards.

- **CPU:** 8-Core (16-Thread) Intel i7/Xeon or equivalent
- **RAM:** 16GB DDR4
- **Storage:** 100GB SSD

Estimated monthly costs depending on operating system:

| Cloud Provider | Machine Size    | Linux                  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| AWS            | c5.2xlarge      | $150 CPU + $20 storage |
| GCP            | c2-standard-8   | $250 CPU + $20 storage |
| Azure          | Standard_F8s_v2 | $180 CPU + $10 storage |
