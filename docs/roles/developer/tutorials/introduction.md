We've included several tutorials to help you develop confidence in your understanding of how to build applications on the NEAR Platform.

Each of the tutorials below includes a rough estimate of the time needed to complete the work, a count of the discrete steps required to complete the work and an estimated level of difficulty, one of: Trivial, Moderate or Challenging.

All of these tutorials are accessible to anyone with some background in software development using any modern programming language, especially JavaScript.
