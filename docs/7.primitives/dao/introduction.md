Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are self-organized groups that form around common purposes. Membership, decision making, and funding are coordinated by publicly voting on proposals through a smart contract.

This section provides some examples how to create or interact with DAO from [a NEAR component](./interacting/bos.md), [web app](./interacting/web-app.md), [near-cli](./interacting/near-cli.md) and [smart contract](./interacting/smart-contract.md).

:::note
In this section we will use as reference the [sputnik dao implementation](https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract).
