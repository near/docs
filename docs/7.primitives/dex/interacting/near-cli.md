This section shows how to interact with FTs from your shell using [`near-cli`](../../../4.tools/cli.md).

## Swap tokens

This snippet will enable your users to swap FTs.

We will use [Ref Finance](https://app.ref.finance/) as an AMM contract in this section.

:::warning
Before initiating any actions related with swapping tokens you must have to check that a wallet has a sufficient storage deposit on a token's smart contract. Otherwise, tokens may be stucked in the contract's "owner" account and you will need to solve this issue via Ref Finance support.
