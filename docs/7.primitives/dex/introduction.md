DEX is an app which allows users to trade tokens by using only smart contracts. Usually users interact with DEX by web app. But since DEX is a set of smart contracts you can use these contracts from your code.

This section provides some examples how to interact with DEX from [a NEAR component](./interacting/bos), [web app](./interacting/web-app), [near-cli](./interacting/near-cli) and [smart contract](./interacting/smart-contract).

:::note
[Ref Finance](https://www.ref.finance/) is used as DEX in examples. If you want to add another DEX you can create a PR on docs repository.
