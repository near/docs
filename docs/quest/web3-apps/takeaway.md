## The Big Picture

Web3 applications represent a fundamental shift in how we think about digital services:

- **Instead of trusting companies**, we trust the blockchain network
- **Instead of giving up control**, we maintain control of our data and assets
- **Instead of being locked in**, we can use our assets across different apps
- **Instead of geographic restrictions**, we have global access to services

This isn't just about technology - it's about creating a more fair, transparent, and user-controlled internet where you're not just a product being sold to advertisers.

- **The frontend** provides the familiar user interface that connects everything together
- **NEAR Protocol** makes Web3 apps user-friendly with low costs and fast transactions
- **The future** of Web3 apps focuses on user ownership, transparency, and global access

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you navigate the world of Web3 applications, whether you're a developer looking to build them or a user wanting to understand how they work!
