3. Gaming
4. Community Governance

## Examples Explained

Let's take a closer look at some of these examples and real projects built on NEAR Protocol.

### Financial Apps

Think of apps like digital banks, but without the bank. You can lend money to others and earn interest, or swap one type of token for another, all automatically. Existing examples in NEAR include [Ref Finance](https://ref.finance/) (a decentralized exchange) and [NEAR Intents](https://app.near-intents.org) (a lending platform).

### Community Governance

Groups of people can make decisions together through transparent voting systems. No more wondering if your vote actually counted - everything is recorded on the blockchain. [NEAR Treasury](https://neartreasury.com/) and [Astra++](https://near.social/astraplusplus.ndctools.near/widget/home) are examples of community governance in action.

### Digital Art and Collectibles

Artists can create unique digital artwork that's verified as authentic and owned by specific people. These can be bought, sold, and traded just like physical art.

### Gaming

Imagine playing a game where the items you earn or buy are actually yours - you can trade them with other players or even sell them. The game items are stored on the blockchain, so they persist even if the game company disappears.
