Now that you understand how Web3 apps work, let's explore the fundamental building blocks that make these applications possible. These building blocks are called **primitives** - the basic components that developers use to create complex Web3 applications.

Think of primitives like the basic LEGO blocks that you can combine to build anything from a simple house to a complex castle. In the same way, Web3 primitives are the basic components that can be combined to create everything from simple token transfers to complex decentralized applications.

## What Makes Primitives Special?

**Primitives** are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 applications. They're like the basic tools in a toolbox - each one serves a specific purpose, and when combined together, they can create complex and powerful applications.

### Why Do We Need Primitives?

Imagine trying to build a house without any standardized materials. You'd have to create every brick, every piece of wood, and every nail from scratch. That would be incredibly inefficient!

Web3 primitives work the same way - they provide standardized, reusable components that developers can use to build applications quickly and securely. Instead of every developer creating their own token system from scratch, they can use the standard token primitive.

### The Benefits of Primitives

**Standardization**: Everyone uses the same basic components, making applications compatible with each other

**Security**: Primitives are battle-tested and secure, reducing the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities

**Efficiency**: Developers can focus on building unique features instead of reinventing basic functionality

**Interoperability**: Applications built with the same primitives can work together seamlessly

## The Core NEAR Primitives

NEAR Protocol provides several key primitives that form the foundation of Web3 applications:

### 1. Fungible Tokens (FT) - Digital Money

**Fungible tokens** are like digital money, each token is identical and interchangeable. Think of them like dollar bills, one dollar bill is exactly the same as any other dollar bill.

**Real-world examples:**
- **NEAR tokens** - The native currency of the NEAR network
- **USDC** - A digital version of US dollars
- **Company tokens** - Digital shares or loyalty points

**Key characteristics:**
- **Interchangeable**: One token is exactly the same as another
- **Divisible**: Can be split into smaller units (like cents)
- **Uniform**: All tokens of the same type are identical

### 2. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) - Unique Digital Items

**Non-fungible tokens** are unique digital items that can't be replaced or exchanged for identical items. Think of them like collectible trading cards, each card is unique and has different value.

**Real-world examples:**
- **Digital art** - Unique pieces of artwork
- **Gaming items** - Special weapons or characters in games
- **Identity documents** - Digital certificates or licenses
- **Event tickets** - Unique tickets to concerts or events

**Key characteristics:**
- **Unique**: Each NFT is one-of-a-kind
- **Indivisible**: Can't be split into smaller pieces
- **Verifiable**: Ownership can be proven on the blockchain

### 3. Linkdrops - Easy Token Distribution

**Linkdrops** are like digital gift cards that can be shared through simple links, instead of needing a wallet to receive tokens, anyone can claim them through a web link.

**Real-world examples:**
- **Airdrops** - Free tokens distributed to community members
- **Gift cards** - Digital gift cards that can be shared via email or social media
- **Event tickets** - Tickets that can be claimed through a simple link
- **Rewards** - Loyalty points or rewards that can be easily distributed

**Key characteristics:**
- **No wallet required**: Recipients don't need a blockchain wallet
- **Easy sharing**: Can be shared through any communication method
- **Secure**: Only the intended recipient can claim the tokens
- **User-friendly**: Makes blockchain technology accessible to everyone

### 4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) - Community Governance

**DAOs** are like digital cooperatives where members vote on decisions using blockchain technology, think of them like a digital version of a board meeting, but with transparent voting and automatic execution of decisions.

**Real-world examples:**
- **Investment clubs** - Groups that pool money and vote on investments
- **Community funds** - Neighborhood associations that manage shared resources
- **Artistic collectives** - Groups of artists who vote on exhibitions and projects
- **Charitable organizations** - Transparent organizations where donors vote on how funds are used

**Key characteristics:**
- **Democratic**: All members can vote on proposals
- **Transparent**: All votes and decisions are recorded on the blockchain
- **Automatic**: Decisions are executed automatically when approved
- **Decentralized**: No single person controls the organization

## How Primitives Work Together

The real power of primitives comes from combining them to create complex applications. Let's look at some examples:

### Example 1: A Digital Art Marketplace

**Primitives used:**
- **NFTs** for unique artwork
- **Fungible tokens** for payments
- **DAOs** for community governance

**How it works:**
1. Artists create NFTs representing their artwork
2. Buyers use fungible tokens (like NEAR) to purchase NFTs
3. A DAO governs the marketplace rules and fees
4. All transactions are transparent and secure

### Example 2: A Gaming Platform

**Primitives used:**
- **NFTs** for unique game items
- **Fungible tokens** for in-game currency
- **Linkdrops** for distributing rewards

**How it works:**
1. Players earn fungible tokens by playing games
2. Players can purchase or earn unique NFT items
3. Rewards are distributed via linkdrops to new players
4. All items are truly owned by players and can be traded

### Example 3: A Community Investment Fund

**Primitives used:**
- **Fungible tokens** for membership shares
- **DAOs** for voting on investments
- **Linkdrops** for distributing profits

**How it works:**
1. Members purchase fungible tokens representing shares
2. DAO votes on which projects to invest in
3. Profits are distributed via linkdrops to token holders
4. All decisions and distributions are transparent

## The Technical Side of Primitives

While primitives are designed to be simple for end users, they're built on sophisticated blockchain technology:

### Smart Contracts
Each primitive is implemented as a **smart contract** - a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain. These contracts:
- **Store data** about tokens, NFTs, and DAO decisions
- **Execute logic** automatically when conditions are met
- **Ensure security** through cryptographic verification
- **Provide transparency** by recording all actions publicly

### Standards and Compatibility
NEAR primitives follow established standards (like NEP-141 for fungible tokens) that ensure:
- **Compatibility** between different applications
- **Security** through battle-tested code
- **Efficiency** through optimized implementations
- **Interoperability** across the entire ecosystem

### Gas and Transaction Costs
Using primitives requires small transaction fees (gas) that:
- **Prevent spam** and keep the network secure
- **Pay validators** for processing transactions
- **Are typically very small** (often less than a penny)
- **Scale with usage** - more complex operations cost slightly more

## Real-World Applications

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
- **Lending platforms** using fungible tokens for loans
- **DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges)** for trading tokens
- **Yield farming** with DAO-governed reward distribution

### Gaming and Entertainment
- **Play-to-earn games** with NFT items and token rewards
- **Virtual worlds** with NFT land ownership
- **Digital collectibles** with verifiable scarcity

### Social and Community
- **Social tokens** representing community membership
- **Creator economies** with NFT-based content ownership
- **Community governance** through DAO voting

### Business and Enterprise
- **Supply chain tracking** with NFT-based product authentication
- **Loyalty programs** using fungible tokens
- **Corporate governance** through DAO structures
