## Introduction to NEAR Accounts

Welcome to the world of NEAR accounts! In this lesson, we'll explore how NEAR Protocol's account system works and why it's designed to be more user-friendly than traditional blockchain accounts.

## What Makes NEAR Accounts Special?

**NEAR Accounts** are your personal space on the blockchain, allowing you to:
- **Hold** tokens and collectibles
- **Make and receive transfers**
- **Create and Interact** with decentralized applications
- **Control accounts on other blockchains** (like Ethereum or Bitcoin)
<!-- - **Help onboard new users** by covering their transaction costs -->

A key difference with other chains is that, instead of having an address like `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D`, you can have a simple named like `alice.near` which is much easier to remember and share!

Another unique feature of NEAR is that accounts can have multiple keys with different permission levels, allowing for more flexible and secure account management.

Finally, in NEAR all accounts are also smart contracts, meaning you can program them to have custom behaviors and logic!
