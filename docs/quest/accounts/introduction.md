## What Makes NEAR Accounts Special?

A **NEAR Account** is your personal space on the blockchain that you can use to:
- **Store digital assets** such as tokens and collectibles
- **Receive and send transactions** to other accounts
- **Interact with smart contracts** and decentralized applications
- **Control accounts on other blockchains** (like Ethereum or Bitcoin)
<!-- - **Help onboard new users** by covering their transaction costs -->

The key difference with other chains is that, instead of having an address like `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D`, you can have a simple named like `alice.near` which is much easier to remember and share!
