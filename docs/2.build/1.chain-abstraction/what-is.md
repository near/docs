# What is Chain Abstraction?

Blockchain development today faces a critical challenge: users need to understand complex blockchain concepts, manage multiple wallets, and deal with different networks just to use basic applications. Chain abstraction solves this by making blockchain technology invisible to end users while preserving all of the underlying benefits.

## Why Chain Abstraction Matters

For **developers**, chain abstraction means:

- Building cross-chain applications without managing multiple blockchain integrations
- Focusing on application logic instead of blockchain complexity
- Reaching users regardless of their preferred blockchain network

For **users**, it means:

- Using blockchain applications as easily as traditional web apps
- No need to understand which blockchain they're interacting with or if they are even using one
- A seamless experience across different networks and tokens

:::info Example
Imagine building a digital art marketplace where users can purchase NFTs from different blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, etc.). Without chain abstraction, you'd need to:

- Implement multiple blockchain connections
- Handle different wallet types
- Manage cross-chain transfers
- Build complex UIs to explain blockchain concepts

With chain abstraction, both you and your users just focus on the core experience: browsing and trading art. All blockchain complexity is handled automatically behind the scenes.

## Overview

NEAR's chain abstraction framework consists of three core technologies that work together to create seamless cross-chain experiences:

1. [**Intent / Solver Layer**](#intent--solver-layer): A decentralized system where users express desired outcomes (like "swap Token A for Token B at the best price") without specifying technical details. A network of solvers then competes to fulfill these intents optimally, handling complex cross-chain operations behind the scenes.

2. [**Chain Signatures**](#chain-signatures): Enables NEAR accounts, including smart contracts, to sign and execute transactions on other blockchains (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), allowing cross-chain interactions.

3. [**OmniBridge**](#omnibridge): A trustless multi-chain asset bridge that combines Chain Signatures for cross-chain transaction execution with a verification layer allowing NEAR smart contracts to confirm transactions on foreign chains. This creates a fully trustless system where NEAR can both initiate and verify cross-chain operations.

### Intent / Solver Layer

The Intent / Solver Layer (aka [NEAR Intents](https://pages.near.org/blog/introducing-near-intents/)) is a new type of transaction that allows information, requests, assets, and actions to be exchanged between users, services, and AI agents.

This represents a paradigm shift in how users and AI agents interact with blockchain networks. Instead of directly executing complex transactions across multiple chains, users simply declare what they want to achieve, and the network determines how to make it happen.

Here's how it works:

1. **Users/Agents Submit Intents**: Express desired outcomes without specifying the technical details (e.g., "Get the best price for my Bitcoin across all DEXs and CEXs")
2. **Solver Network Competes**: A decentralized network of solvers (both AI agents and traditional market makers) compete to fulfill these intents optimally
3. **Cross-Chain Execution**: The best solution is automatically executed, potentially spanning multiple chains and services

:::info Example
Instead of a user having to:

1. Bridge assets between chains
2. Find the best trading venues
3. Execute multiple transactions
4. Handle different wallet requirements

They simply submit an intent: "Swap Token A for Token B at the best price"
The Intent Layer handles all complexity across Web2 and Web3 behind the scenes.
:::

For developers, the Intent Layer provides:

- A unified framework for building cross-chain applications
- Access to both AI agents and traditional solvers for transaction optimization
- Built-in liquidity aggregation across DeFi and CeFi
- Support for complex use cases beyond simple swaps, including:
  - Cross-chain stablecoin operations
  - DeFi programmability for non-smart contract assets
  - Account-based trading (AccountFi)
  - AI agent interactions and negotiations

NEAR Intents are designed to power both traditional DeFi operations and the emerging AI economy, creating a unified transaction framework for Web2 and Web3 interactions.

### Chain Signatures

Chain Signatures enable NEAR accounts, including smart contracts, to sign and execute transactions across many blockchain protocols. By using [Multi-Party Computation (MPC)](../../1.concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures.md#multi-party-computation-service), this technology allows a single NEAR account to control accounts and assets on external chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Base.

Key benefits include:

- Single Account, Multi-Chain Operations: Manage multiple blockchain interactions from one NEAR account
- Reduced Development Overhead: Write smart contracts on NEAR that directly sign cross-chain transactions
- Secure Transaction Signing: Leverage decentralized MPC for trustless signature generation

For example, this enables dApps built on NEAR to interact with Bitcoin's UTXO model or Ethereum's account model, powering use cases like cross-chain DeFi protocols, atomic swaps, and NFT marketplaces.

### OmniBridge

The [OmniBridge](https://github.com/Near-One/omni-bridge) extends NEAR's chain abstraction capabilities by combining two key elements: Chain Signatures for cross-chain transaction execution, and a verification layer that allows NEAR smart contracts to confirm the state and transactions on foreign chains. This creates a trustless bridge where NEAR contracts can both initiate and verify cross-chain operations.

1. **Chain Signatures Integration**:
   - NEAR smart contracts can generate derivation addresses on other blockchains
   - These contracts can directly sign and execute transactions on external chains

2. **State Verification Layer (Omniprover)**:
   - Allows NEAR smart contracts to verify the state and transactions on foreign chains
   - Supports different verification methods based on the target chain (e.g., light client proofs)
   - Ensures trustless verification of incoming transfers and state changes from external chains
   - For example, when receiving assets from Ethereum, NEAR contracts can verify the deposit actually occurred

3. **Decentralized Relayer Network**:
   - Open participation model for relayers
   - Trustless and incentivized system
   - Ensures efficient transaction processing and state updates across chains

This architecture creates a fully trustless bridge by combining NEAR's ability to execute transactions on foreign chains (via Chain Signatures) with the capability to independently verify the results of those transactions (via Omniprover).
