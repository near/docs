title: Choose your Dev Environment

The environments in which you can develop `Components` are divided into two categories:

- [Web Tools](#web-tools): Online tools that allow you to quickly start building and sharing components.
- [Local Tools](#local-tools): Tools that allow you to develop and test components locally.

:::tip Handling collaborations
If you plan to collaborate with multiple people, we recommend you to check [this repository template](https://github.com/near-examples/bos-components) which automatically deploys components each time a PR is merged.

## Web Tools
The quickest way to start building NEAR Components is by using one of the online tools. They are great for taking your first steps, while they let you find other developers and components in the NEAR ecosystem.

#### [Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai)
[Jutsu.ai](https://jutsu.ai) is a web IDE made for NEAR developers. It contains examples and tutorials to help onboarding you.

## Local Tools

If you want to collaborate with a team or work on a larger project, you will likely want more **version control**, automated testing and deployment, and other workflows. For this, the NEAR ecosystem offers a set of tools to easily develop and test your components entirely locally.
