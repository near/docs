In this guide we will show you how to quickly spin up a frontend where users can **login** using their wallets and interact with a **contract**.

:::tip Searching to integrate NEAR in your App?
If you already have an application and want to integrate NEAR into it, we recommend you to first go through this guide and then check our documentation on [integrating NEAR to a frontend](./integrate-contracts.md)
:::

---

## Create NEAR App
If you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed, simply run:

```bash 
  npx create-near-app@latest
```

Use the interactive menu to set up:
1. `A Web App`.
2. `NextJs (Classic)`.

:::tip Using pnpm
While you can use our app with any package manager, we recommend you to skip the installation step and manually install the dependencies using `pnpm i`.
:::

Once the folder is ready - and all dependencies installed - you can start the development server using `pnpm`. 

```bash 
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the dApp. Note that since the dApp uses NextJS the app might take longer to load the pages on first visit.

Make sure you are using **node >= v18**, you can easily switch versions using `nvm use 18`

## Landing Page

Once the app starts you will see the landing page, rendering a navigation bar that allows users to login using their NEAR wallet. You can then navigate to the docs or the `Near Integration` page (which we will do).

Go ahead and sign in with your NEAR account. If you don't have one, you can create one on the fly.

### Under the Hood

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) uses a template system, where each page is a React component.

Our app's template is defined at `./src/pages/_app.js`. It does two things:

1. Initializes a [wallet selector](../../4.tools/wallet-selector.md), and stores it in context so other components can access it later.
2. Renders the navigation menu and the page's content.

<Github url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/_app.js" language="jsx" start="9" end="22" />

When initializing the `wallet` you can choose to create a [function call access key](../../1.concepts/protocol/access-keys.md) for a specific contract for the application to use. This allows the application to sign `non-payable` methods on behalf of the user so they are not required to manually sign each transaction.

```jsx
const wallet = new Wallet({
  createAccessKeyFor: HelloNearContract,
  networkId: NetworkId,
});
```

This example additionally includes the option to login with `Metamask` and other `EVM wallets`. Further information on how to add EVM wallets to your application can be found in the [Ethereum Wallets on NEAR documentation](../../4.tools/ethereum-wallets.md).

<details>
<summary>What is the wallet selector?</summary>

The wallet selector is a modal that allows users to select their preferred Near wallet to login. Our application creates a new instance of the wallet selector then stores it in the apps context so it can be accessed by other components.

</details>

<hr className="subsection" />

### Navigation Bar & Login
The navigation bar implements buttons to `login` and `logout` users with their Near wallet.

The code for the navigation bar can be found at `./src/components/navigation.js`. The login and logout buttons are implemented by using the `signIn` and `signOut` methods from the wallet selector previously initialized:

<Github url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/master/frontend/src/components/navigation.js" language="jsx" start="10" end="23" />

---

## Interacting with NEAR

Now that you understand how the landing page works, we can move to the `Near Integration` page, which retrieves a greeting from the [hello.near-examples.testnet](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/hello.near-examples.testnet) contract.

![img](/docs/assets/examples/hello-near-gateway.png)
*View of the `Near Integration` page*

Login if you haven't done it yet and you will see a simple form that allows you to store a greeting in the smart contract.

<hr className="subsection" />

### Under the Hood
We retrieve the `wallet` we initialized earlier via the `useContext` hook. The wallet allows us to interact with the smart contract through `viewMethod` and `callMethod`.

- `viewMethod` is used to call functions that are read-only
- `callMethod` is used to call functions that modify the state of the contract 

<Github url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/master/frontend/src/pages/hello-near/index.js" language="jsx" start="13" end="36" />

On load, the first `useEffect` hook will call the contract's `get_greeting` method and set the `greeting` state to the result.

If the user is logged in, the user will be able to use the `saveGreeting` function which will call the contract's `set_greeting` method and then update the `greeting`.

## Moving Forward

That's it for our quickstart tutorial. You have now seen a fully functional frontend that can talk with NEAR contracts and render Web3 components.

Happy coding!
