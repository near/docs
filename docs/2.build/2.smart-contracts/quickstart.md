Welcome! [NEAR accounts](../../1.concepts/protocol/account-model.md) can store small apps known as smart contracts. In this quick tutorial, we will guide you in creating your first contract on the NEAR **testnet**!

Join us in creating a friendly contract that stores a greeting, and exposes functions to interact with it.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure to set up your development environment.

:::note
Some `near-cli` commands have two versions - a **full** one and a **short** one. If you want to explore all options provided by `near-cli` use [the interactive mode](../../4.tools/cli.md#interactive-mode).
:::

:::tip Testnet Account

There is no need to have a `testnet` account to follow this tutorial.

However, if you want to create one, you can do so through [a wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com), and use it from the `near-cli` by invoking `near login`.

## Creating the Contract

Create a smart contract by using one of the scaffolding tools and following their instructions:

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">


```bash
  npx create-near-app@latest
```

![img](@site/static/docs/hello-near-ts.gif)
_Creating a project using `create-near-app`_

This will generate a project with the following structure:

```bash
├── sandbox-test    # sanbox testing
│   └── main.ava.js
├── src             # contract's code
│   └── contract.ts
├── README.md
├── package.json    # package manager
└── tsconfig.json
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

```bash
  cargo near new <project_name>
```

![img](@site/static/docs/hello-near-rs.gif)
_Creating a project using `cargo near new`_

This will generate a project with the following structure:

```bash
├── src        # contract's code
│   └── lib.rs
├── tests      # sandbox testing
│   └── test_basics.rs
├── Cargo.toml # package manager
├── README.md
└── rust-toolchain.toml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## The Contract

The `Hello World` smart contract stores a greeting in its state, and exposes two functions to interact with it:
1. `set_greeting`: to change the greeting
2. `get_greeting`: to fetch the greeting

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

    <Github fname="index.js" language="js"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/contract-ts/src/contract.ts"
            start="4" end="22" />

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

    <Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust"
            url="https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples/blob/main/contract-rs/src/lib.rs"
            start="4" end="32" />

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip

After finishing this tutorial, check our [contract's anatomy](./anatomy/anatomy.md) page to learn more about the contract's structure

## Test the Contract

Building and testing the contract is as simple as running the `test` command. The contract will be compiled and the tests will be executed.

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ````

    <details>
    <summary> Failing tests? </summary>

    Make sure that you are using `node v18`, `v20` or `v22`. You can always use: `nvm use 18` to switch to `node v20`

    </details>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

In the background, these commands are calling the build tools for each language and using a [Sandbox](./testing/integration-test.md) to test the contract.

:::tip Sandbox
Testing the contracts within a Sandbox allows you to understand how the contract will behave once deployed to the network while having total control over the testing environment.
:::

---

## Create a Testnet Account

Now that you know the contract is passing the tests, let's create a `testnet` account in which to deploy the contract. [`near-cli`](../../4.tools/cli.md) supports two versions of some commands - full and short one. It's up to you which format you prefer, but full version provides more features.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

    ```bash
    # Replace <your-account-id.testnet> with a custom name
    near create-account <your-account-id.testnet> --useFaucet
    ```

    <details>
    <summary> Example Result </summary>

    ```bash
    $> near create-account lovely-event.testnet --useFaucet
    # New account "lovely-event.testnet" created successfully
    ```

    </details>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

    ```bash
    # Replace <your-account-id.testnet> with a custom name
    near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service <your-account-id.testnet> autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create
    ````

    <details>
    <summary> Example Result </summary>

    ```bash
    $> near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service lovely-event.testnet autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create

    # New account "lovely-event.testnet" created successfully
    ```

    </details>

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


:::tip

Remember that you can create a named account through any wallet (i.e. [MyNearWallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com)) and then use it from the `near-cli` by invoking `near login`.

## Build the Contract

When you are ready to create a build of the contract run a one-line command depending on your environment.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

  ```bash
  cargo near build
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

---

## Deploy the Contract

Having our account created, we can now deploy the contract:


<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="🌐 JavaScript">

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  near deploy <created-account> build/hello_near.wasm
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

  ```bash
  near contract deploy <created-account> use-file ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello.wasm without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

  <Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  near deploy <created-account> ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello.wasm
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

  ```bash
  near contract deploy <created-account> use-file ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello.wasm without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Congrats**! Your contract now lives in the NEAR testnet network.

## Interacting with the Contract

To interact with your deployed smart contract, you can call its functions through the command line.

<hr class="subsection" />

#### Get Greeting

The `get_greeting` function only reads from the contract's state, and can thus be called for **free**.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

    ```bash
    > near view <created-account> get_greeting
    # "Hello"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

    ```bash
    > near contract call-function as-read-only <created-account> get_greeting json-args {} network-config testnet now
    # "Hello"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr class="subsection" />

#### Set Greeting

The `set_greeting` method writes on the contract's [storage](./anatomy/storage.md), and thus requires a user to sign a transaction in order to be executed.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  > near call <created-account> set_greeting '{"greeting": "Hola"}' --accountId <created-account>
  # Log: Saving greeting "Hola"
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

    ```bash
    > near contract call-function as-transaction <created-account> set_greeting json-args '{"greeting": "Hola"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <created-account> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
    #Log: Saving greeting "Hola"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

Notice that we are signing the transaction using `<created-account>`, so in this case, we are asking the contract's account to call its own function

## Moving Forward

That's it for the quickstart tutorial. You have now seen a fully functional contract with a minimal user interface and testing.

To better understand the contract's structure, check our [contract's anatomy](./anatomy/anatomy.md) page.

If you prefer to see more examples, check our [examples](/tutorials/examples/count-near) page.
