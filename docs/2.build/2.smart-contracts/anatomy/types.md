Lets discuss which types smart contracts use to input and output data, as well as how such data is stored and handled in the contract's code.

<ExplainCode languages="js,rust">

<Block highlights='{"js":"5,8,13"}' fname="hello-near">

    ### Native Types
    Smart contracts can receive, store and return data using JS native types:
    - `string`
    - `number`
    - `boolean`
    - `Array`
    - `Map`
    - `Object`
    - `BigInt`

</Block>

<Block highlights='{"rust":"6,13,22,27"}' fname="hello-near">

    ### Native Types
    Smart contracts can receive, store and return data using the following Rust types:
    - `string`
    - `i8-i32/u8-u32`
    - **`u64/128`**: It is preferable to use SDK types `U64` and `U128`
    - `bool`
    - `HashMap`
    - `Vector`

</Block>

<Block highlights='{"rust": "1,15,22,64"}' fname="auction" type='info'>

:::warning `U64/U128`

Smart contracts can store `u64` and `u128`, but these types need to be converted to `string` for input/output, since JSON cannot serialize values with more than 52 bits

To simplify development, the SDK provides the `U64` and `U128` types which are automatically casted to `u64/u128` when stored, and to `string` when used as input/output

    ### Complex Objects
    Smart contracts can store and return complex objects

    **Note:** Objects will always be received and returned as JSON

</Block>

<Block highlights='{"rust": "4"}' fname="auction">

    #### Serializers
    Objects that will be used as input or output need to be serializable to JSON, add the `#[near(serializer=json)]` macro

    Objects that will be stored in the contract's state need to be serializable to Borsh, add the `#[near(serializer=borsh)]` macro

</Block>

<Block highlights='{"js": "5,11,25,47"}' fname="auction">

    ### Handling Tokens
    `$NEAR` tokens are typed as `BigInt` in JS, and their values represented in `yoctonear`

    **Note:** 1 NEAR = 10^24 yoctoNEAR

</Block>

<Block highlights='{"rust": "8,26,41"}' fname="auction">

    ### Handling Tokens
    `$NEAR` tokens are handled through the `NearToken` struct, which exposes methods to represent the value in `yoctonear`, `milinear` and `near`

    **Note:** 1 NEAR = 10^24 yoctonear

    ### Account
    The SDK exposes a special type to handle NEAR Accounts, which automatically checks if the account address is valid
