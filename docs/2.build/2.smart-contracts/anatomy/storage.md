NEAR accounts store data for their contracts. The storage starts **empty** until a contract is deployed and the state is initialized. The contract's code and state are independent: updating the code does not erase the state.

    ### Defining the State
    The attributes of the `class` marked as the contract define the data that will be stored
    
    The contract can store all native types (e.g. `number`, `string`, `Array`, `Map`) as well as complex objects

    For example, our Auction contract stores when the auction ends, and an object representing the highest bid

    **Note:** The SDK also provides [collections](./collections.md) to efficiently store collections of data
  </Block>

    ### Defining the State
    The attributes of the `struct` marked as the contract define the data that will be stored

    The contract can store all native types (e.g. `u8`, `string`, `HashMap`, `Vector`) as well as complex objects
    
    For example, our Auction contract stores when the auction ends, and an object representing the highest bid

    **Note:** The structures that will be saved need a special macro, that tells the SDK to store them [serialized in Borsh](./serialization.md)

    **Note:** The SDK also provides [collections](./collections.md) to efficiently store collections of data

  <Block highlights={{"rust": "4"}} fname="auction">
    #### [*] Note
    The `structs` that will be persisted need to be marked with a macro, so the SDK knows to [serialize them in Borsh](./serialization.md) before writing them to the state
  </Block>

  <Block highlights={{"js":"", "rust": ""}} fname="auction">
    #### [!] Important
    Contracts pay for their storage by locking part of their balance
    
    It currently costs ~**1â“ƒ** to store **100KB** of data

    ### Initializing the State
    After the contract is deployed, its state is empty and needs to be initialized with
    some initial values

    There are two ways to initialize a state:
      1. By creating an initilization function
      2. By setting default values
  </Block>
    <Block highlights={{"js": "8,13-17"}} fname="auction">
    ### I. Initialization Functions
    An option to initialize the state is to create an `initialization` function, which needs to be called before executing any other function

    In our Auction example, the contract has an initialization function that sets when the auction ends. Note the `@initialization` decorator, and the forced initialization on `NearBindgen`
    
    **Note:** It is a good practice to mark initialization functions as private. We will cover function types in the [functions section](./functions.md)
  </Block>
  <Block highlights={{"js": "10-11"}} fname="auction">
    #### [!] Important
    In TS/JS you still **must** set default values for the attributes, so the SDK can infer their types
  </Block>
  <Block highlights={{"rust": "12,22-30"}} fname="auction">
    ### I. Initialization Functions
    An option to initialize the state is to create an `initialization` function, which needs to be called before executing any other function

    In our Auction example, the contract has an initialization function that sets when the auction ends. The contract derives the `PanicOnDefault`, which forces the user to call the init method denoted by the `#[init]` macro
    
    **Note:** It is a good practice to mark initialization functions as private. We will cover function types in the [functions section](./functions.md)
  </Block>

  <Block highlights={{"js": "5"}} fname="hello">
    ### II. Default State
    Another option to initialize the state is to set default values for the attributes of the class

    Such is the case for our "Hello World" contract, which stores a `greeting` with the default value `"Hello"`

    The first time the contract is called (somebody executes `get_greeting` or `set_greeting`), the default values will be stored in the state, and the state will be considered initialized

    **Note:** The state can only be initialized once
  </Block>
  <Block highlights={{"rust": "10-16"}} fname="hello">
    ### II. Default State
    Another option to initialize the state is to create a `Default` version of our contract's `struct`.
    
    For example, our "Hello World" contract has a default state with a `greeting` set to `"Hello"`

    The first time the contract executes, the `Default` will be stored in the state, and the state will be considered initialized

    **Note:** The state can only be initialized once
  </Block>
  <Block highlights={{"js": "", "rust":""}} fname="hello">
    ### Lifecycle of the State
    When a function is called, the contract's state is loaded from the storage and put into memory

    The state is actually [stored serialized](./serialization.md), and the SDK takes a bit of time to deserialize it before the method can access it

    When the method finishes executing successfully, all the changes to the state are serialized, and saved back to the storage
  </Block>
  <Block highlights={{"js": "", "rust":""}} fname="hello">
    ### State and Code
    In NEAR, the contract's code and contract's storage are **independent**
    
    Updating the code of a contract does **not erase** the state, and can indeed lead to unexpected behavior or errors

    Make sure to read the [updating a contract](../release/upgrade.md) if you ran into issues
