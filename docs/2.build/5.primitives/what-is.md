Primitives are fundamental building blocks that can be combined to create a fully functional application. Blockchain primitives include [Fungible Tokens (FT)](#fungible-tokens-ft), [Non Fungible Tokens (NFT)](#non-fungible-tokens-nft), [Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAO)](#decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao), [Link Drops](#linkdrops) and more.

#### Fungible Tokens (FT)
[Fungible tokens](./ft.md) represent an **asset** on a blockchain that is **interchangeable**. Besides the native NEAR token, users can issue their own fungible tokens or use those that are already present in the ecosystem.

:::tip
Fungible Tokens are ideal to create **reward systems**, **fair tickets** and any other type of **token**.

#### Non Fungible Tokens (NFT)
In contrast with fungible tokens, each [non-fungible token (NFT)](./nft.md) is **unitary** and therefore **unique**. Users can create their own non-fungible token, transfer to other users, or exchange them in marketplaces.

:::tip
NFTs are ideal to represent **ownership of assets** such as **collectibles**, **event tickets** and other unique assets.

#### Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAO)
[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)](./dao.md) are **self-organized groups** that form around common purposes. Membership, decision making, and funding are **coordinated** by **publicly voting** on proposals through a smart contract.

:::tip
DAOs are ideal to create **decentralized governance**, **funding**, and **decision-making** tools.

### LinkDrops
[LinkDrops](./linkdrop.md) are an easy way to **distribute digital assets** (NFTs, FTs) via links. You simply **provide a link** for users and they can **claim** your drop.

:::tip
LinkDrops are ideal to do **drops**, and **onboard new users** into Web3 apps.
