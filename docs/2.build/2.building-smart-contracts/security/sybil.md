While developing your smart contract, keep in mind that an individual can potentially create multiple NEAR accounts. This is especially relevant in ecosystems involving crowd decisions, such as [DAOs](../../../2.develop/relevant-contracts/dao.md). 

Imagine that you open the voting to anyone in the community. If each account can cast a vote, a malicious actor could span multiple accounts and gain a disproportionately large influence on the result.
