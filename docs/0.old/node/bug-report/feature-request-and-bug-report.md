## Feature Request and Bug Report {#feature-request-and-bug-report}

The NEAR team is actively solicitating feedback from the Node and Validator Community, and offers a process for the community to engage in feature / enhancement requests and to submit bug reports. Besides the existing NEAR Validator channels, the NEAR team is introducing a formal process for feature requests and bug reports.

With respect to the experience of operating a NEAR node, all bugs and feature enhancements are publicly tracked in the Github project tracker [`Node Experience`](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/42). Node operators are welcome to create new issues for features and bugs, and to add these issues into the [Github project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/42).

- **New Feature / Enhancement Request:**
  - Please create a [`Github issue`](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues)
  - The issue will be reviewed and filtered through `Incoming Requests` column in the Github project [`Node Experience`](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/42), where they will be groomed and slated for development based on priority

- **Bug Report:**
  - For node operator issues, please create a Zendesk issue here https://near-node.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new for the NodeX team, and try to attach your logs.
