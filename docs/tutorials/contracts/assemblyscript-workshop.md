### [AssemblyScript Starter Kit](https://github.com/Learn-NEAR/starter--near-sdk-as)
> This workshop includes a complete project structure for AssemblyScript contracts targeting the NEAR platform.

The example here is very basic. It's a simple contract demonstrating the following concepts:

- a single contract
- the difference between view and change methods
- basic contract storage

### [Exploring AssemblyScript Contracts](https://github.com/near-examples/workshop--exploring-assemblyscript-contracts)
> This workshop is a more comprehensive project that includes several activities:

- a scavenger hunt through several AssemblyScript projects to get you quickly oriented
- a debugging challenge to fix a few failing unit tests with broken contracts
- a development lifecycle challenge to guide you through NEAR platform tools for testing
- a design challenge to create new contracts and related models that satisfy a set of requirements
