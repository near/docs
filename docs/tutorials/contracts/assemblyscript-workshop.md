**[ [This workshop](https://github.com/near-examples/workshop--exploring-assemblyscript-contracts) ]** includes several activities:

- a scavenger hunt through several AssemblyScript projects to get you quickly oriented
- a debugging challenge to fix a few failing unit tests with broken contracts
- a development lifecycle challenge to guide you through NEAR platform tools for testing
- a design challenge to create new contracts and related models that satisfy a set of requirements

**Prerequisites**

If you're already comfortable with TypeScript then reading AssemblyScript should be a breeze. If you're coming from JavaScript, you'll have to get your head around `static types` and code compilation (since JavaScript has dynamic types and is an interpreted language) but reading through the samples here should not be too difficult. If you have no programming experience then this workshop will be challenging for you -- find someone to pair with so you can stay motivated and productive.
