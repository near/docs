## Introduction

We have now finished the NFT contract and will be exploring some key aspects of the marketplace contract. At the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of how the marketplace functions and interacts with the NFT contract. For users that wanna follow along and continue with their previous work that’s fine. For users that are starting at this point, they should checkout the `6.royalty` branch.

## Modifications to the contract

We will modify the package.json build script and add a folder for the marketplace contract. We will go through and create each file in the marketplace contract and paste the contents into the file while explaining some of the core functions and their behaviors.

```rust reference
https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/tree/7.market/nft-contract/src/lib.rs#L1-L3
```

We can have users deploy the contract, put something for sale, test the enumerable methods, and maybe purchase an NFT with a second account. 

## Conclusion

Everything is finished! ;) #devdocs4life
