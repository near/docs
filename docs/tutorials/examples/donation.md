use near_sdk::{env, near_bindgen, AccountId, Promise};
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Donation {
    pub donor: AccountId,
    pub amount: u128,
}

#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
pub struct DonationContract {
    beneficiary: AccountId,
    donations: Vec<Donation>,
} ```
