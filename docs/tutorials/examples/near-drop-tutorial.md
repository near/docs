# NEAR Drop Tutorial: Seamless Token Distribution

Ever wondered how to get tokens into users' hands without them jumping through blockchain hoops? Welcome to NEAR Drops - the elegant solution that makes token distribution feel like sharing a simple web link.

In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into building a token drop system that eliminates the friction of traditional crypto transactions while maintaining the security and benefits of blockchain technology.

## Tutorial Overview

This hands-on guide walks you through creating a production-ready token drop system. You'll learn to harness NEAR's unique capabilities to build user experiences that rival traditional web applications.

**By the end, you'll master:**
- The mechanics behind gasless token claiming
- Function Call key implementation for secure, restricted access
- Multi-token drop systems (NEAR, FTs, NFTs)
- Production deployment and security considerations

**Time to complete:** 45-60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Smart contract basics, NEAR fundamentals

## The Token Drop Problem Space

### Why Traditional Crypto Distribution Fails

Picture this scenario: You want to reward 500 conference attendees with tokens. Using traditional methods, each person would need to:

- Install and configure a crypto wallet
- Understand seed phrases and private keys  
- Acquire NEAR tokens for gas fees
- Navigate blockchain transaction interfaces
- Risk losing funds through user error

**Result?** Most users never claim their rewards.

### NEAR's Game-Changing Approach

NEAR Drops flip this model completely. Instead of requiring crypto expertise, recipients simply:

1. Click a link (like any web URL)
2. Choose to claim tokens  
3. Get an account created automatically
4. Receive tokens instantly

**No wallets, no gas fees, no technical knowledge required.**

---

## Function Call Keys: The Technical Foundation

### Understanding Restricted Access

Function Call keys are NEAR's secret weapon for user-friendly blockchain interactions. Unlike traditional private keys that control entire accounts, Function Call keys operate under strict limitations:

**Scope Restrictions:**
- Can only call specific contract methods
- Cannot transfer account ownership
- Cannot access stored funds beyond designated functions
- Auto-expire based on predefined rules

**Security Benefits:**
- Key compromise doesn't threaten entire accounts
- Granular permission systems  
- Automatic cleanup prevents long-term exposure
- Built-in rate limiting capabilities

### The Drop Architecture

Here's how Function Call keys enable seamless drops:

```
1. Drop Creator â†’ Deposits tokens + generates key pairs
2. Smart Contract â†’ Registers public keys with restricted permissions  
3. Private Keys â†’ Embedded in shareable URLs
4. Recipients â†’ Use URLs to trigger token claims
5. Contract â†’ Validates keys and distributes tokens
6. System â†’ Cleans up expired or used keys
```

This architecture ensures security while eliminating user friction.

## Contract Deep Dive

### State Management Strategy

The contract employs a three-layer state system optimized for efficiency and security:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust"
       url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/lib.rs"
       start="22" end="29" />

**Layer 1: Key Mapping** - `drop_id_by_key` provides instant key validation  
**Layer 2: Drop Storage** - `drop_by_id` holds drop-specific data with minimal footprint  
**Layer 3: ID Generation** - `next_drop_id` ensures unique identifiers without collisions

### Multi-Token Support Architecture

NEAR Drops support three distinct token types, each with unique requirements:

<Language value="rust" language="rust">
<Github fname="drop_types.rs"
   url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/drop_types.rs"
   start="8" end="16" />
</Language>

**Design Philosophy:** Each token type inherits common claiming logic while maintaining type-specific validation and distribution mechanisms.

### Step 2: Implement Drop Creation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="NEAR" label="NEAR Token Drops">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="create_near_drop"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/lib.rs"
        start="44" end="66" />
      <Github fname="near_drop_implementation"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/near_drop.rs"
        start="63" end="95" />
    </Language>
    
    **Key Considerations:**
    - Account creation requires ~0.1 NEAR minimum
    - Storage costs scale with key quantity
    - Batch creation optimizes transaction fees
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="FT" label="Fungible Token Drops">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="create_ft_drop"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/lib.rs"
        start="68" end="89" />
      <Github fname="ft_drop_implementation"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/ft_drop.rs"
        start="108" end="142" />
    </Language>
    
    **Integration Requirements:**
    - Token contract must implement NEP-141 standard
    - Sufficient allowance for drop contract
    - Proper decimal handling for token amounts
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="NFT" label="NFT Drops">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="create_nft_drop"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/lib.rs"
        start="91" end="103" />
      <Github fname="nft_drop_implementation"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/nft_drop.rs"
        start="80" end="106" />
    </Language>
    
    **Special Handling:**
    - Each NFT requires individual drop creation
    - Metadata verification before drop creation
    - Royalty and creator fee considerations
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Optimize Storage Economics

Drop creation involves calculated storage costs:

**Primary Storage:** Drop data structures and mappings  
**Key Storage:** Function Call key registration fees  
**Mapping Storage:** PublicKey â†’ DropId relationship data

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Implement automatic cleanup for claimed drops
- Use efficient data structures (minimize string storage)
- Batch operations to reduce per-transaction overhead
- Plan drop lifecycle to minimize storage duration

## Claiming Mechanisms

### Dual-Path Claiming System

The contract accommodates both existing NEAR users and newcomers:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="existing" label="Existing Account Claims">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="claim_existing"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="11" end="14" />
      <Github fname="claim_logic"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="58" end="85" />
    </Language>
    
    **Flow:** Key validation â†’ Drop lookup â†’ Token transfer â†’ State cleanup
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="new" label="New Account Creation">
    <Language value="rust" language="rust">
      <Github fname="create_and_claim"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="16" end="41" />
      <Github fname="account_resolution"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/near-drop/blob/main/src/claim.rs"
        start="43" end="56" />
    </Language>
    
    **Flow:** Account creation â†’ Initial funding â†’ Token claiming â†’ Access key setup
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
