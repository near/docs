This example showcases how to interact with multiple contracts from a single frontend.

Particularly, this example shows how to:

1. Query data from multiple contracts.
2. Call methods in multiple contracts simultaneously.

---

## Query Data from Multiple Contracts

To query multiple contracts simply perform multiple `view` calls:

<Language value="js" language="ts">
  <Github fname="index.js"
        url="https://github.com/near-examples/frontend-multiple-contracts/blob/main/frontend/index.js"
        start="70" end="76" />
</Language>

---

## Dispatching Multiple Transactions

The `wallet` object enables to dispatch multiple transactions simultaneously. However, please notice that the transactions execute independently.

Dispatching multiple transactions at once is just a nice way to improve UX, because the user interacts with the wallet only once.

<Language value="js" language="ts">
  <Github fname="index.js"
          url="https://github.com/near-examples/frontend-multiple-contracts/blob/main/frontend/index.js"
          start="35" end="62" />
</Language>

In this example, the user signs two independent transactions:

1. A transaction to call `set_greeting` in our [Hello NEAR example](https://github.com/near-examples/hello-near-examples)
2. A transaction to call `add_message` in our [GuestBook example](https://github.com/near-examples/guest-book-examples)

:::caution
Even when the user accepts signing the transactions at the same time, the
transactions remain **independent**. This is, if one fails, the other is **NOT** rolled back.

## Batch Actions

You can aggregate multiple [actions](../../smart-contracts/anatomy/actions.md) directed towards a same contract into a single transaction. Batched actions execute **sequentially**, with the added benefit that, if **one fails** then they **all** get reverted.

```js
  // Register a user and transfer them FT on a single take
  const REGISTER_DEPOSIT = "1250000000000000000000";

  const ftTx = {
    receiverId: FT_ADDRESS,
    actions: [
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'storage_deposit',
          args: { account_id: "<receiver-account>" },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS, deposit: REGISTER_DEPOSIT
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'ft_transfer',
          args: { receiver_id: "<receiver-account>", amount: amount_in_yocto },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS, deposit: 1 }
      }
    ]
  }

  // Ask the wallet to sign and send the transaction
  await wallet.signAndSendTransactions({ transactions: [ ftTx ] })
```

## üìö Tutorial: Multi-Contract Flow in a Real dApp

In many dApps (especially DeFi), you need to:

1. **Read** data from multiple contracts (balances, app state, staking info).
2. **Perform** multiple independent transactions in one wallet prompt.
3. **Batch** several actions into a single transaction when they target the same contract.

Here‚Äôs a real-world style example.

---

### Step 1:  Query Multiple Contracts in Parallel

```js
const view = (contractId, method, args = {}) =>
  wallet.viewMethod({ contractId, method, args });

async function loadDashboard(accountId) {
  const [storageBalance, storageBounds, messages] = await Promise.all([
    view('ft.example.near', 'storage_balance_of', { account_id: accountId }),
    view('ft.example.near', 'storage_balance_bounds'),
    view('guest-book.testnet', 'getMessages', { from_index: 0, limit: 10 }),
  ]);

  return {
    isRegistered: !!storageBalance,
    storageMin: storageBounds?.min,
    messages,
  };
}
```

**Why:** View calls are cheap, parallelizable, and safe, they never change blockchain state.

---

### Step 2: Batch Actions for Atomic Execution

If the user isn‚Äôt registered on an FT contract, register them **and** transfer tokens in one atomic transaction:

```js
const THIRTY_TGAS = '30000000000000';

async function registerAndTransferFT({ receiverId, amountYocto, registerDepositYocto }) {
  const tx = {
    receiverId: 'ft.example.near',
    actions: [
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'storage_deposit',
          args: { account_id: receiverId },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
          deposit: registerDepositYocto
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'ft_transfer',
          args: { receiver_id: receiverId, amount: amountYocto },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
          deposit: '1'
        },
      },
    ],
  };

  return wallet.signAndSendTransactions({ transactions: [tx] });
}
```

**Why:** All-or-nothing execution means no half-registered users without tokens.

---

### Step 3: Multiple Independent Transactions in a single Prompt

You can send **two or more transactions** to different contracts in the same wallet flow:

```js
async function postGuestBookMessage(text) {
  return {
    receiverId: 'guest-book.testnet',
    actions: [
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'addMessage',
          args: { text },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
          deposit: '10000000000000000000000'
        },
      },
    ],
  };
}

async function combinedFlow(receiverId, amountYocto, registerDepositYocto, message) {
  const ftTx = {
    receiverId: 'ft.example.near',
    actions: [
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'storage_deposit',
          args: { account_id: receiverId },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
          deposit: registerDepositYocto,
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'FunctionCall',
        params: {
          methodName: 'ft_transfer',
          args: { receiver_id: receiverId, amount: amountYocto },
          gas: THIRTY_TGAS,
          deposit: '1',
        },
      },
    ],
  };

  const guestBookTx = await postGuestBookMessage(message);

  return wallet.signAndSendTransactions({ transactions: [ftTx, guestBookTx] });
}
```

**Why:** Reduces prompts for better UX.

‚ùó **Note:** These transactions are **independent** if one fails, the other still runs.

## Rust Contract Snippets

Smart contract examples used in the frontend flows above ‚Äî  
a **Fungible Token contract** (following the [NEP-141 standard](https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Core))  
and a **Guest Book contract** for storing messages.

---

### Fungible Token (FT) Contract

```rust
#[near_bindgen]
impl FungibleTokenContract {
    /// Registers an account in the FT contract's internal storage.
    /// This is required before the account can hold any tokens.
    #[payable] // must allow attaching NEAR for storage costs
    pub fn storage_deposit(&mut self, account_id: Option<AccountId>) {
        let id = account_id.unwrap_or(env::predecessor_account_id());

        // Inserts a zero balance for this account.
        // If the account is already registered, panic to prevent overpaying.
        assert!(
            self.accounts.insert(&id, &0u128).is_none(),
            "Already registered"
        );
    }

    /// Transfers tokens from the sender to another account.
    #[payable] // 1 yocto‚ìÉ is required for security (prevents accidental calls)
    pub fn ft_transfer(&mut self, receiver_id: AccountId, amount: U128) {
        assert_one_yocto(); // ensures exactly 1 yocto‚ìÉ is attached

        let sender_id = env::predecessor_account_id();

        // Internal method handles balance updates and event logging
        self.internal_transfer(&sender_id, &receiver_id, amount.into());
    }
}
````

**Explanation:**

* `#[near_bindgen]` makes the struct‚Äôs methods callable from the blockchain.
* **`storage_deposit`**:

  * Required by the NEP-141 standard.
  * Attaches a deposit to cover the contract's per-account storage cost.
  * Prevents double-registration by panicking if the account already exists.
* **`ft_transfer`**:

  * Also from NEP-141.
  * Requires exactly `1 yocto‚ìÉ` to avoid accidental calls from other contracts (anti-spam measure).
  * Uses `internal_transfer` to update balances and emit events.

---

### Guest Book Contract

```rust
#[near_bindgen]
impl GuestBook {
    /// Adds a message to the on-chain guest book.
    #[payable] // allows attaching deposit to cover storage cost
    pub fn add_message(&mut self, text: String) {
        let sender = env::predecessor_account_id();

        // Append the new message with sender info
        self.messages.push(Message { sender, text });
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The guest book maintains a vector of `Message` structs.
* **`#[payable]`** is needed because storing data on NEAR costs gas *and* requires attaching NEAR for storage staking.
* `env::predecessor_account_id()` retrieves the account that signed and sent the transaction.
* Messages are appended to the contract‚Äôs persistent state ‚Äî
  any deposit beyond what‚Äôs needed for storage is usually refunded automatically by the runtime.

---

### Why These Matter for Multi-Contract Frontends

* The **FT contract** needs two actions in sequence:

  1. `storage_deposit` (if the user isn‚Äôt registered yet).
  2. `ft_transfer` (to send tokens).

  * These are often **batched into one atomic transaction**.
* The **Guest Book contract** is completely separate:

  * The frontend calls `add_message` in its own transaction.
  * Can be sent together with the FT transaction in the same wallet prompt, but they remain independent on-chain.


## Note

* **Multiple view calls** ‚Üí query many contracts quickly in parallel.
* **Batch actions** ‚Üí atomic operations on the same contract.
* **Multiple transactions in one wallet prompt** ‚Üí independent execution across contracts.
* **Storage staking** ‚Üí always check `storage_balance_of` and attach the required deposit.
