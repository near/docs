description: "Learn NFTs from minting to building a full-featured smart contract in this Zero to Hero series."
---

> In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
> You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.



## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Node.js](/smart-contracts/quickstart?code-tabs=js)
- [A NEAR Wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/create)
- [NEAR-CLI](/tools/near-cli#installation)

| 4    | [Upgrade a contract](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial-js/upgrade-contract)        | Discover the process to upgrade an existing smart contract.                                                            |
| 5    | [Enumeration](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial-js/enumeration)                    | Explore enumeration methods that can be used to return the smart contract's states.                                    |

| 7    | [Approvals](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial-js/approvals)                        | Expand the contract allowing other accounts to transfer NFTs on your behalf.                                           |
| 8    | [Royalty](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial-js/royalty)                            | Add NFT royalties allowing for a set percentage to be paid out to the token creator.                                   |
