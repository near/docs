This is where NEAR gets really cool. Function-call access keys are what make gasless claiming possible - let's understand how they work!

## The Problem NEAR Solves

Traditional blockchains have a chicken-and-egg problem:
- You need tokens to pay gas fees
- But you need gas to receive tokens
- New users are stuck!

NEAR's solution: **Function-call access keys** that let you call specific functions without owning the account.

---

## How Access Keys Work

NEAR has two types of keys:

**Full Access Keys** üîë
- Complete control over an account
- Can do anything: transfer tokens, deploy contracts, etc.
- Like having admin access

**Function-Call Keys** üé´  
- Limited permissions
- Can only call specific functions
- Like having a concert ticket - gets you in, but only to your seat

---

## NEAR Drop's Key Magic

Here's what happens when you create a drop:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/contract/src/lib.rs"
        start="140" end="170" />

**The result**: Recipients can claim tokens without having NEAR accounts or paying gas!

---

## Key Permissions Breakdown

Function-call keys in NEAR Drop have strict limits:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/contract/src/lib.rs"
        start="8" end="20" />

**What keys CAN do:**
- Call `claim_for` to claim to existing accounts
- Call `create_account_and_claim` to create new accounts
- Use up to 0.005 NEAR worth of gas

**What keys CANNOT do:**
- Transfer tokens from the contract
- Call any other functions
- Deploy contracts or change state maliciously
- Exceed their gas allowance

---

## Key Lifecycle

The lifecycle is simple and secure:

```
1. CREATE ‚Üí Add key with limited permissions
2. SHARE ‚Üí Give private key to recipient  
3. CLAIM ‚Üí Recipient uses key to claim tokens
4. CLEANUP ‚Üí Remove key after use (prevents reuse)
```

Here's the cleanup code:

<Github fname="claim.rs" language="rust" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/contract/src/claim.rs"
        start="200" end="220" />

---

## Advanced Key Patterns

### Time-Limited Keys

You can make keys that expire:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/contract/src/lib.rs"
        start="300" end="330" />

### Key Rotation

For extra security, you can rotate keys:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/contract/src/lib.rs"
        start="350" end="380" />

---

## Security Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use minimal gas allowances (0.005 NEAR is plenty)
- Remove keys immediately after use
- Validate key formats before adding
- Monitor key usage patterns

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Give keys excessive gas allowances
- Reuse keys for multiple drops
- Skip cleanup after claims
- Log private keys anywhere

---

## Gas Usage Monitoring

Track how much gas your keys use:

<Github fname="lib.rs" language="rust" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/contract/src/lib.rs"
        start="400" end="420" />

---

## Integration with Frontend

Your frontend can generate keys securely:

<Github fname="crypto.js" language="javascript" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Drop/blob/main/src/utils/crypto.js"
        start="1" end="30" />

Create claim URLs:

<Github fname="crypto.js" language="javascript" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Drop/blob/main/src/utils/crypto.js"
        start="32" end="45" />

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Access key not found"**
- Key wasn't added properly to the contract
- Key was already used and cleaned up
- Check the public key format

**"Method not allowed"**
- Trying to call a function not in the allowed methods list
- Our keys only allow `claim_for` and `create_account_and_claim`

**"Insufficient allowance"**
- Key ran out of gas budget
- Increase `FUNCTION_CALL_ALLOWANCE` if needed

**"Key already exists"**
- Trying to add a duplicate key
- Generate new unique keys for each drop

---

## Why This Matters

Function-call access keys are NEAR's superpower for user experience:

üéØ **No Onboarding Friction**: New users can interact immediately
‚ö° **Gasless Operations**: Recipients don't pay anything  
üîí **Still Secure**: Keys have minimal, specific permissions
üöÄ **Scalable**: Works for any number of recipients

This is what makes NEAR Drop possible - without function-call keys, you'd need a completely different (and much more complex) approach.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how the gasless magic works, let's see how to create new NEAR accounts during the claiming process.

:::tip Key Insight
Function-call access keys are like giving someone a specific key to your house that only opens one room and only works once. It's secure, limited, and perfect for token distribution!
