import {Github} from "@site/src/components/codetabs"

Ever wanted to give tokens to someone who doesn't have a NEAR account? Or send an airdrop without recipients needing gas fees? That's exactly what we're building!

**NEAR Drop** lets you create token distributions that anyone can claim with just a private key - no NEAR account or gas fees required.

---

## What You'll Build

A complete token distribution system with:

- **NEAR Token Drops**: Send native NEAR to multiple people
- **FT Drops**: Distribute any NEP-141 token (like stablecoins) 
- **NFT Drops**: Give away unique NFTs
- **Gasless Claims**: Recipients don't pay any fees
- **Auto Account Creation**: New users get NEAR accounts automatically

---

## How It Works

1. **Create Drop**: You generate private keys and link them to tokens
2. **Share Keys**: Send private keys via links, QR codes, etc.
3. **Gasless Claims**: Recipients use keys to claim without gas fees
4. **Account Creation**: New users get NEAR accounts created automatically

The magic? **Function-call access keys** - NEAR's unique feature that enables gasless operations.

## Project Structure

Your completed project will look like this:

<Github fname="README.md" language="bash" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Near-drop/blob/main/README.md"
        start="10" end="30" />

The frontend structure:

<Github fname="package.json" language="json" 
        url="https://github.com/Festivemena/Drop/blob/main/package.json"
        start="1" end="30" />

---

## Real Examples

- **Community Airdrop**: Give 5 NEAR to 100 community members
- **Event NFTs**: Distribute commemorative NFTs at conferences  
- **Onboarding**: Welcome new users with token gifts
- **Gaming Rewards**: Drop in-game items to players

## What You Need

- [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs/)
- [NEAR CLI](../../tools/cli.md#installation)
- [A NEAR wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com)
- Basic understanding of smart contracts

cd Near-drop

# Build and deploy
cd contract
cargo near build
near deploy <your-account>.testnet target/near/near_drop.wasm

# Clone the frontend
git clone https://github.com/Festivemena/Drop.git
cd Drop
npm install
npm run dev
```
