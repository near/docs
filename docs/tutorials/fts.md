title: Fungible Tokens Zero to Hero
sidebar_label: Introduction
description: "Master NEAR fungible tokens from pre-deployed contracts to building fully-featured FT smart contracts."
---

In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials covering every aspect of a fungible token (FT) smart contract. You'll start by interacting with a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll have built a fully-fledged FT smart contract that supports every extension of the standards.

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](/smart-contracts/quickstart#prerequisites)
- [A NEAR wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com)
- [NEAR-CLI](/tools/near-cli#installation)
- [cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near)

:::info New to Rust?
If you are new to Rust and want to dive into smart contract development, our [Quick-start guide](https://docs.near.org/smart-contracts/quickstart) is a great place to start.

| 1    | [Pre-deployed contract](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/predeployed-contract) | Receive FTs without the need to code, create, or deploy a smart contract.                                                                       |
| 2    | [Contract architecture](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/skeleton)             | Learn the basic architecture of the FT smart contract and compile the code.                                                                     |
| 3    | [Defining a Token](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/defining-a-token)          | Flesh out what it means to have a FT and how you can customize your own.                                                                         |
| 4    | [Circulating Supply](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/circulating-supply)      | Learn how to create an initial supply and have the token show up in your wallet.                                                                |
| 5    | [Registering Accounts](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/registering-accounts)  | Explore how you can implement and understand the storage management standard to avoid malicious users from draining your funds.                 |
| 6    | [Transferring FTs](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/transfers)                 | Learn how to transfer FTs and discover some of the true powers that the core standard brings                                                    |
| 7    | [Marketplace](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/marketplace)                    | Learn about how common marketplaces operate on NEAR and dive into some of the code that allows buying and selling NFTs by using Fungible Tokens. |

<!--
1. [Events](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/events): in this tutorial you'll explore the events extension, allowing the contract to react on certain events.
1. [Marketplace](https://near-examples.github.io/ft-tutorial/marketplace): in the last tutorial you'll be exploring some key aspects of the marketplace contract.
