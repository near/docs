This tutorial presents the NEAR sample application called NEAR Wallet Integration

<blockquote class="info">
<strong>did you know?</strong><br><br>

NEAR Wallet is also discussed in the following Guides

- [JavaScript library Guides - Create an Account](/docs/roles/developer/examples/near-api-js/guides)
- [JavaScript library Guides - Send Yourself Money](/docs/roles/developer/examples/near-api-js/guides)

</blockquote>

If you haven't done so already ...

> In a new browser tab or window
> - Open [Examples](https://near.dev)
>
> - Select **Example of NEAR Wallet Integration**
> - Click **Open in Gitpod**

The sample application will be created and opened.  You can immediately test and deploy, everything should work.

> In Gitpod
> - To test, run the following command in the gitpod command line box
```bash
yarn test
```

![NEAR tests for NEAR Wallet integration sample](/docs/assets/near-studio-tests-near-wallet-integration.png)

Note: you may need to increase the timeout for the tests if they fail

> In the file `src/test.js`
> - Find the line for setting `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL` and increase to `20000`

```js
jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 20000;  // <-- edit this line
```

> In Gitpod
> - To start the application, run the following command in the gitpod command line box (you may need to terminate previous process e.g. by Ctrl + C.)
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Understanding the environment

> In the file `src/config.js`
> - Open the file and inspect its contents to understand the configuration settings.

```js
(function() {
  const CONTRACT_NAME = 'near-hello-testnet'; /* TODO: fill this in! */
  const DEFAULT_ENV = 'development';

  function getConfig(env) {
    switch (env) {

    case 'production':
    case 'development':
      return {
        networkId: 'default',
        nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.testnet.near.org',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
        walletUrl: 'https://wallet.testnet.near.org',
        helperUrl: 'https://helper.testnet.near.org',
      };
    case 'betanet':
      return {
        networkId: 'betanet',
        nodeUrl: 'https://rpc.betanet.near.org',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
        walletUrl: 'https://wallet.betanet.near.org',
        helperUrl: 'https://helper.betanet.near.org',
      };
    case 'local':
      return {
        networkId: 'local',
        nodeUrl: 'http://localhost:3030',
        keyPath: `${process.env.HOME}/.near/validator_key.json`,
        walletUrl: 'http://localhost:4000/wallet',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
      };
    case 'test':
      return {
        networkId: 'local',
        nodeUrl: 'http://localhost:3030',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
        masterAccount: 'test.near',
      };
    case 'test-remote':
    case 'ci':
      return {
        networkId: 'shared-test',
        nodeUrl: 'http://shared-test.near.org:3030',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
        masterAccount: 'test.near',
      };
    case 'ci-staging':
      return {
        networkId: 'shared-test-staging',
        nodeUrl: 'http://staging-shared-test.near.org:3030',
        contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
        masterAccount: 'test.near',
      };
    default:
      throw Error(`Unconfigured environment '${env}'. Can be configured in src/config.js.`);
    }
  }

  const cookieConfig = typeof Cookies != 'undefined' && Cookies.getJSON('fiddleConfig');
  if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
    module.exports = getConfig;
  } else {
    window.nearConfig =  cookieConfig && cookieConfig.nearPages ? cookieConfig : getConfig(DEFAULT_ENV);
  }
})();
```


### Understanding the contract

> In the file `assembly/main.ts`
> - Open the file and read the comments to understand how it works

Note that:
- smart contracts depend on [`near-sdk-as`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-as) for all NEAR-specific features
- smart contracts must `export` functions to make them available for use
- `context.sender` represents the account that is calling the contract
- `logging.log()` is used to send messages to the JavaScript Developer Console in the browser
- `storage.setString()` and `storage.getString()` are used to read and write data to a key-value store dedicated to the smart contract

```ts
import { context, storage, logging } from "near-sdk-as";
// --- contract code goes below

// It's good to use common constant, but not required.
const LAST_SENDER_KEY = "last_sender";

// This is our change method. It modifies the state of the contract by
// storing the account_id of the sender under the key "last_sender" on the blockchain
export function sayHi(): void {
  // context.sender is the account_id of the user who sent this call to the contract
  // It's provided by the Blockchain runtime. For now we just store it in a local variable.
  let sender = context.sender;
  // `near` class contains some helper functions, e.g. logging.
  // Logs are not persistently stored on the blockchain, but produced by the blockchain runtime.
  // It's helpful to use logs for debugging your functions or when you need to get some info
  // from the change methods (since change methods don't return values to the front-end).
  logging.log(sender + " says \"Hi!\"");
  // storage is a helper class that allows contracts to modify the persistent state
  // and read from it. setString allows you to persitently store a string value for a given string key.
  // We'll store the last sender of this contract who called this method.
  storage.setString(LAST_SENDER_KEY, sender);
}

// This is our view method. It returns the last account_id of a sender who called `sayHi`.
// It reads value from the persistent store under the key "last_sender" and returns it.
export function whoSaidHi(): string | null {
  // getString returns a string value for a given string key.
  return storage.getString(LAST_SENDER_KEY);
}
```

### Understanding the front end


> In the file `src/main.js`
> - Open the file and read the comments to understand how it works

Note that:
- `initContract()` kicks off the loading of the app
- `nearAPI.connect()` is how we connect to the NEAR blockchain
- `BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore` is what we use to store keys (in your LocalStorage)
- `viewMethods` and `changeMethods` are the smart contract methods where `viewMethods` do not modify the state of the blockchain and `changeMethods` do

```js
// Initializing contract
async function initContract() {
  console.log('nearConfig', nearConfig);

  // Initializing connection to the NEAR testnet
  window.near = await nearAPI.connect(Object.assign({ deps: { keyStore: new nearAPI.keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore() } }, nearConfig));

  // Initializing Wallet based Account. It can work with NEAR testnet wallet that
  // is hosted at https://wallet.testnet.near.org
  window.walletAccount = new nearAPI.WalletAccount(window.near);

  // Getting the Account ID. If unauthorized yet, it's just empty string.
  window.accountId = window.walletAccount.getAccountId();

  // Initializing our contract APIs by contract name and configuration.
  window.contract = await near.loadContract(nearConfig.contractName, {
    // NOTE: This configuration only needed while NEAR is still in development
    // View methods are read only. They don't modify the state, but usually return some value.
    viewMethods: ['whoSaidHi'],
    // Change methods can modify the state. But you don't receive the returned value when called.
    changeMethods: ['sayHi'],
    // Sender is the account ID to initialize transactions.
    sender: window.accountId,
  });
}

// Using initialized contract
async function doWork() {
  // Setting up refresh button
  document.getElementById('refresh-button').addEventListener('click', updateWhoSaidHi);

  // Based on whether you've authorized, checking which flow we should go.
  if (!window.walletAccount.isSignedIn()) {
    signedOutFlow();
  } else {
    signedInFlow();
  }
}

// Function that initializes the signIn button using WalletAccount
function signedOutFlow() {
  // Displaying the signed out flow container.
  document.getElementById('signed-out-flow').classList.remove('d-none');
  // Adding an event to a sing-in button.
  document.getElementById('sign-in-button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    window.walletAccount.requestSignIn(
      // The contract name that would be authorized to be called by the user's account.
      window.nearConfig.contractName,
      // This is the app name. It can be anything.
      'Who was the last person to say "Hi!"?',
      // We can also provide URLs to redirect on success and failure.
      // The current URL is used by default.
    );
  });
}

// Main function for the signed-in flow (already authorized by the wallet).
function signedInFlow() {
  // Displaying the signed in flow container.
  document.getElementById('signed-in-flow').classList.remove('d-none');

  // Displaying current account name.
  document.getElementById('account-id').innerText = window.accountId;

  // Adding an event to a say-hi button.
  document.getElementById('say-hi').addEventListener('click', () => {
    // We call say Hi and then update who said Hi last.
    window.contract.sayHi().then(updateWhoSaidHi);
  });

  // Adding an event to a sing-out button.
  document.getElementById('sign-out-button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    walletAccount.signOut();
    // Forcing redirect.
    window.location.replace(window.location.origin + window.location.pathname);
  });
}

// Function to update who said hi
function updateWhoSaidHi() {
  // JavaScript tip:
  // This is another example of how to use promises. Since this function is not async,
  // we can't await for `contract.whoSaidHi()`, instead we attaching a callback function
  // usin `.then()`.
  contract.whoSaidHi().then((who) => {
    // If the result doesn't have a value we fallback to the text
    document.getElementById('who').innerText = who || 'Nobody (but you can be the first)';
  });
}

// Loads near-api-js and this contract into window scope.
window.nearInitPromise = initContract()
  .then(doWork)
  .catch(console.error);
```
