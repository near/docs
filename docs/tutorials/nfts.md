description: "Learn how to mint NFTs and build a full NFT contract step by step."

In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [A Testnet wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/create)
- [NEAR-CLI](/tools/near-cli#installation)
- [cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near)

| 2    | [Contract architecture](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial/skeleton)             | Learn the basic architecture of the NFT smart contract and compile code.                                               |
| 3    | [Minting](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial/minting)                            | Flesh out the skeleton so the smart contract can mint a non-fungible token.                                            |
| 4    | [Upgrade a contract](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial/upgrade-contract)        | Discover the process to upgrade an existing smart contract.                                                            |
| 5    | [Enumeration](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial/enumeration)                    | Explore enumeration methods that can be used to return the smart contract's states.                                    |

| 7    | [Events](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial/events)                              | The events extension, allowing the contract to react on certain events.                                              |
| 8    | [Approvals](https://near-examples.github.io/nft-tutorial/approvals)                        | Expand the contract allowing other accounts to transfer NFTs on your behalf.                                           |
