title: Exploring NEAR Protocol APIs
sidebar_label: API Workshop
---

**[ [This workshop](https://github.com/near-examples/workshop--exploring-near-apis) ]** includes several activities:

- a client-side playground to better understand how [`near-api-js`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js) works
- a console-based challenge to practice using [`near-cli`](/docs/tools/near-cli) to manage keys, create accounts and deploy contracts
- a monitoring challenge to apply lessons about `near-api-js` and `JSON RPC API` into a single interface

**Prerequisites**

If you're already comfortable with JavaScript, the command line and JSON RPC APIs then this should be a breeze. If you're unfamiliar with the NEAR APIs and have limited or no experience with our network then this workshop will be very helpful. If you have no programming experience then this workshop will be challenging for you -- find someone to pair with so you can stay motivated and productive.
