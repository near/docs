## NEAR Protocol

In technical terms, NEAR is a [layer-one](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/layer-1-blockchain), [sharded](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption), [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) blockchain built with usability in mind.

[Layer-1](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) means NEAR is the foundation that supports everything else built on it. It keeps all the transaction records safe and unchangeable which keeps the network secure and trustworthy.

[Sharded](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption) means the network is broken into pieces that work in parallel. This helps NEAR process transactions quickly and efficiently.

[Proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) uses less electricity compared with other blockchains which use proof-of-work. Users show they own NEAR tokens to help run the network. This makes it cheaper and lets more people use it.
