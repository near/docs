# What you will need

- You will need at least 100$ USD. Some of this money will be burnt in transfer fees, so not all of it will be directed into your wallet
- A Near Mainnet Wallet, please go wallet.near.org to create your wallet also if you need someone to fund your wallet you can reach out to one of the NEAR DevRel Team members on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/UY9Xf2k) channel to help kickstart your wallet

**Before you connect to you're NEAR Wallet** Please Make sure that you're wallet is not ledger protected (meaning you aren't using a Ledger to store your access keys) this application does not work with Ledger protected wallets, if you do have one please make another wallet and secure it with a security phrase for now.

- A CryptoWallet. For the purposes of this tutorial we will be using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download).

Once this transfer process has been completed open your MetaMask browser extension should show your new wETH balance. Despite the different values in this screenshot it should look something similar to this depending on how much money you've deposited and swapped.
