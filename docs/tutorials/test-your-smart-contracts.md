## A multiplayer "Place" game with shared world state.

Multiplayer games share a single world that all players can affect. Let's build one!

This is commonly set up using a coordinate system which represents locations within the world. Simple key-value mapping stores the state of the world at specific coordinates.

In this tutorial we will write a very simple game with a shared world state. The world is represented as a square playing field with the only property available at each location is its "color". Some of you may recognize this as "place", which made its way around the Internet a while ago.

Below is an example of a large scale version to which many people contributed.

### <center>Let's get started!</center>

## Step 1 - Create a new Token Contract Project in Gitpod

> In a new browser tab or window
> - Open a new Token Contract Project in [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/near-examples/token-contract-as)

When this opens in GitPod, the code will generate a unique NEAR account for this project and build then deploy the template files. You can take a look at what we're starting with by viewing the launched webpage. 

> In Gitpod terminal tab
> - `CMD + click` on `http://localhost:1234`

This sample project has a token smart contract and also some JavaScript tests that invoke smart contract functions. There are two testing suites that perform these tests, AS-pect and Jest. 
  * Jest allows us to perform integration tests on NEAR's testnet network. 
  * AS-pect allows us to test our smart contract on a locally mocked network.

You can try running these tests right away to see the code interacting with the blockchain.

To run these tests...

> In Gitpod
> - click **Terminal** >> **New Terminal** 
>
> In the new tab that opens at the bottom of Gitpod
> - type `yarn test` in the command prompt

This will run both testing suites and log the results to your console. If you would like to run just one of the testing suites, you can type the following in your terminal.

- `yarn asp` to run only AS-pect tests
- `yarn jest` to run only Jest tests

Go ahead and explore the code in these tests to get a better understanding of the actions they perform. 
* AS-pect test files are located in `assembly/__tests__/example.spec.ts` & `token.spec.ts`

- The Jest test file is located in `src/test.js`

Once the testing suites are complete, your test results should look like this:

**AS-pect Test**
![Token Contract AS-pect test](/docs/assets/token-contract-aspect-test.png)

**Jest Test**
![Default Token Contract Test ](/docs/assets/default-token-contract-test.png)

Note that `test-account-tTIMESTAMP-XXXXXXX` is an automatically generated NEAR account for this particular project. Try not to be distracted by these details, but compare the developer log output with the statements in the file `src/test.js`.

<blockquote class="warning">
<strong>heads up</strong><br><br>

We are not going to keep any of the code from this template. It's just there as a starting point.

</blockquote>

## Step 2 - Write a smart contract

In this simple game, we need to create only two actions:

1. View the world state: `getCoords`
2. Make changes to the state at particular coordinates: `setCoords`

> In the file `assembly/main.ts`
> - Replace the **entire contents of the file** with the following code

```ts
import { storage } from "near-sdk-as";

export function setCoords(coords: string, value: string): void {
  storage.setString(coords, value);
}

export function getCoords(coords: string): string {
  let result = storage.getString(coords);
  if(result) {
    return result;
  }

  return "";
}

```

Next we'll need a `getMap` function, which returns the full state of the game \(we don't want to be making a separate call for every coordinate!\)

> In the same file `assembly/main.ts`
> - Append the following code to the bottom

```ts
export function getMap(): string[] {
  let num_rows = 10;
  let num_cols = 10;
  let total_cells = num_rows * num_cols;
  var arrResult:string[] = new Array(total_cells);
  let i = 0;
  for (let row = 0; row < num_rows; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < num_cols; col++) {
      let cellEntry = storage.getString(row.toString() + "," + col.toString());
      if(cellEntry) {
        arrResult[i] = cellEntry;
      } else {
        arrResult[i] = "";
      }

      i++;
    }
  }
  return arrResult;
}

```

This smart contract is now ready to be re-deployed to the NEAR test network, but before we do that, let's test it locally to ensure everything behaves as expected. This is where AS-pect comes in handy!

## Step 3 - Write a couple of tests for the contract

Lets test our code to make sure our smart contract works as expected by writing a JavaScript test in AS-pect.

First lets delete one of the old test files that will no longer work with our new smart contract.

> In Gitpod's explorer 
> - navigate to `assembly/__tests__/` and expand the folder
> - right click on `token.spec.ts` and click **Delete**
> - now click on `example.spec.ts` 
> - Replace the **entire contents of the file** with the following code

```js
import { getMap, setCoords } from "../main";

  describe("getMap", () => {
    it('gets the board state', () => {
       const viewResult = getMap();
       expect(viewResult.length).toBe(100); // board is 10 by 10
    })

  describe("setCoords", () => {
    it("modifies the board state", () => {
      
       setCoords("0,0", "111111")
       const viewResult = getMap();
       //you can send a log to the console by invoking the log() method 
       //log(viewResult[0]);
       expect(viewResult.length).toBe(100); 
       // entry 0,0 should be 111111!
       expect(viewResult[0]).toBe("111111");
    });
  });
});

```
> - Click **File** >> **Save** to save your changes

The "getMap" test simply invokes the `getMap` function of the contract and returns the current state. Our "setCoords" test will modify the game state by updating a coordinate of the map based on the parameters we passed to the `setCoords` function.

***Now run your tests!***

> In your testing terminal
> - type `yarn asp`

Once finished, you should see passing tests that look like the following:

![AS-pect tests for smart contract game](/docs/assets/token-contract-aspect-game-test.png)

Now that we know our code is executing as intended, our newly created smart contract can be deployed with confidence to the blockchain. 

> In your terminal windows 
> - Select the first terminal tab on the left that has localhost server running
> - Hold `CTRL + C` to stop the server and display the command prompt
> - Type `yarn dev` to rebuild and redeploy your modified contract 
>

Notice the console log right above `Server running at http://localhost:1234` that says `Done deploying to dev-159486XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX`. This is the account ID of our smart contract we just created and can also be found in `neardev/dev-account.env`. By entering this ID in the [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/) search bar, we can see all of the account activity. If you look now, you should see confirmation of the contract being deployed as well as a transfer of 500 â“ƒ to the account. This tool will come in handy later so we can view all of the transactions we'll make.

## Step 4 - Make a simple UI

Congratulations! All of your blockchain work is done!

Now, lets make a very simple JavaScript user interface (UI). First, we'll need to initialize the pieces we need so we can interact with the smart contract. Then, we'll write a few functions that will allow us to paint on our canvas and save coordinate changes to the blockchain using the smart contract we wrote above.

> In the file `src/main.js`
> - Replace the values of `viewMethods` and `changeMethods` (lines 17 & 18) with our new smart contract methods.

```js
window.contract = await near.loadContract(nearConfig.contractName, {
  viewMethods: ["getMap"],        // <-- find this line and change it to match
  changeMethods: ["setCoords"],   // <-- find this line and change it to match
  sender: window.walletAccount.getAccountId()
});
```

Now lets write the "NEAR Place" application code.

> In the same file `src/main.js`
> - Append the following code to the bottom of the file
> - Review the code and comments to help you understand what's taking place

```js
// NEAR Place application Code

/**
 * initialize the board with empty colors
 */
function loadBoardAndDraw() {
  const board = getBoard().then(fullMap => {
    const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    let i = 0;
    for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
      for (let y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
        let color = fullMap[i] || "000000";
        ctx.fillStyle = "#" + color;
        ctx.fillRect(x * 10, y * 10, 10, 10);
        i++;
      }
    }
  });
}

/**
 * handle a mouse click event on the canvas element
 * @param event the event raised by mouse click on the canvas
 */
function handleCanvasClick(event) {
  const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  const position = getMousePosition(canvas, event);
  const x = Math.floor(position.x / 10);
  const y = Math.floor(position.y / 10);

  const coords = x + "," + y;
  const rgb = document.getElementById("picker").value;
  ctx.fillStyle = "#" + rgb;
  ctx.fillRect(x * 10, y * 10, 10, 10);

  console.log(`The point (${coords}) was set to color #${rgb}`);
  let args = {
    coords,
    value: rgb
  };
  window.contract.setCoords(args);
}

/**
 * capture the mouse position
 * @param canvas the canvas element on the page
 * @param event the event raised by mouse click on the canvas (see handleCanvasClick)
 */
function getMousePosition(canvas, event) {
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  return {
    x: event.clientX - rect.left,
    y: event.clientY - rect.top
  };
}

/**
 * get the map from the blockchain
 */
async function getBoard() {
  const result = await window.contract.getMap();

  renderBoard(result)
  return result;
}

/**
 * helper function to render the board to the developer console
 */
function renderBoard(board){

  console.log("\n\nThe NEAR Place board is currently stored on the blockchain as ...");
  console.table(array_chunks(board, 10)); // assuming rows are 10 wide

  // src: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks#comment84212474_8495740
  function array_chunks(array, chunk_size){
    return Array(Math.ceil(array.length / chunk_size))
              .fill().map((_, index) => index * chunk_size)
              .map(begin => array.slice(begin, begin + chunk_size))
  }
}

```
Next, update the following block of code so our `loadBoardAndDraw` method gets invoked.

> In the same file `src/main.js`
> - Chain `.then(loadBoardAndDraw)` on line 43 and a half to hook into the application launch process

```js
window.nearInitPromise = connect()
  .then(updateUI)
  .then(loadBoardAndDraw)         // <-- insert this line in this location
  .catch(console.error);
```

Finally, we will need to add an event listener that will call our `handleCanvasClick` function when we interact with the canvas. Copy the code below and insert it right after the other two `document.querySelector` code blocks (line 41 and a half).

```js
document.querySelector('#myCanvas').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  handleCanvasClick(event);
});
```

***Almost done!***

All we have left to do is update our HTML file to render everything as expected.

> In the file `src/index.html`
> - Replace the **entire contents of the file** with the following code

```html

**<center>Thats it! Now let's launch our app and start drawing on the blockchain!</center>**

> In Gitpod
> - go to the first terminal tab that has your running server
> - `CMD + click` on `http://localhost:1234`

This is what the app should look like as soon as it launches:

![NEAR Place webpage on launch](/docs/assets/near-place-webpage-on-launch.png)

**Note:** If you open your JavaScript developer console (open before the page loads, or refresh the page afterwards) you should see a table that looks like this: 

![NEAR Place JavaScript developer console on launch](/docs/assets/near-place-console-on-launch.png)

Go ahead and click **Sign In** to connect this app to your NEAR Wallet. After you log in, you will be redirected back to your app and a small black canvas should appear. Select a color and start creating art on the blockchain! 

![NEAR Place drawing after sign in](/docs/assets/near-place-painting.png)

Each time you click a coordinate and change the color in your canvas we are interacting with the blockchain. The smart contract we wrote earlier gets called, executes the transaction (recording and storing it in state), and logs our signature. Not only will your painting live forever on the network, but so will every brush stroke of its creation!

You can view a summary of these transactions in your [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org) or dive deeper into the details by searching for your account ID or the smart contract account ID in [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.near.org).
