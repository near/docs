Welcome! [NEAR accounts](../protocol/account-model.md) can store small apps known as smart contracts. In this quick tutorial, we will guide you in creating your first contract on the NEAR **testnet**!

Join us in creating a friendly contract that stores a greeting, and exposes functions to interact with it.

## Creating the Contract

Create a smart contract by using one of the scaffolding tools and following their instructions:

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="üåê JavaScript">


```bash
  npx create-near-app@latest
```

![img](@site/static/docs/hello-near-ts.gif)
_Creating a project using `create-near-app`_

This will generate a project with the following structure:

```bash
hello-near
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sandbox-test    # sandbox testing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ava.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src             # contract's code
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contract.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json    # package manager
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

:::tip

We recommend you to name your project `hello-near` for this tutorial, but feel free to use any name you prefer

```bash
  cargo near new hello-near
```

![img](@site/static/docs/hello-near-rs.gif)
_Creating a project using `cargo near new`_

This will generate a project with the following structure:

```bash
hello-near
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src        # contract's code
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests      # sandbox testing

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml # package manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rust-toolchain.toml
```

:::tip

`hello-near` is the name we chose for this project so the tutorial is simpler to follow, but for future projects feel free to use any name you prefer

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="py" label="üêç Python">

Create a new project using `uv init`:

```bash
uv init hello-near
cd hello-near
```

This creates a Python project with the following structure:

```bash
hello-near
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git                 # Git repository
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore           # Git ignore file

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main Python file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml       # Project configuration
```

Now, add the NEAR SDK to your project:

```bash
uv add near-sdk-py
```

## The Contract

The `Hello World` smart contract stores a greeting in its state, and exposes two functions to interact with it:
1. `set_greeting`: to change the greeting
2. `get_greeting`: to fetch the greeting

## Test the Contract

Building and testing the contract is as simple as running the `test` command. The contract will be compiled and the tests will be executed.

<Tabs groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="üåê JavaScript">

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ````

    <details>
    <summary> Failing tests? </summary>

    Make sure that you are using `node v18`, `v20` or `v22` - you can manage multiple versions using `nvm` - and that you have `Rosetta` installed on MacOS if you have an Apple Silicon processor.

    </details>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">

  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="py" label="üêç Python">

  Create a test file for your contract:

  ```bash
  # Create a tests directory
  mkdir tests
  touch tests/test_greeting.py
  ```

  Add the following content to `tests/test_greeting.py`:

  ```python
  from near_pytest.testing import NearTestCase
  import json

  class TestGreetingContract(NearTestCase):
      @classmethod
      def setup_class(cls):
          """Compile and deploy the greeting contract."""
          super().setup_class()
          
          # Compile the contract
          wasm_path = cls.compile_contract(
              "greeting_contract.py", 
              single_file=True
          )
          
          # Deploy the contract
          cls.contract_account = cls.create_account("contract")
          cls.instance = cls.deploy_contract(cls.contract_account, wasm_path)
          
          # Initialize the contract
          cls.instance.call_as(
              account=cls.contract_account,
              method_name="initialize",
              args={"default_message": "Initial greeting"},
          )
          
          # Create test user
          cls.user = cls.create_account("user")
          
          # Save state for future resets
          cls.save_state()
      
      def setup_method(self):
          """Reset state before each test method."""
          self.reset_state()
          
      def test_greeting(self):
          # Set greeting as user
          result = self.instance.call_as(
              account=self.user,
              method_name="set_greeting",
              args={"message": "Hello from test!"}
          )
          result = json.loads(result)
          assert result["success"] == True
          
          # Get greeting
          greeting = self.instance.call_as(
              account=self.user,
              method_name="get_greeting"
          )
          assert greeting == "Hello from test!"
  ```

  Run the test:

  ```bash
  # Add near-pytest to your project
  uv add near-pytest
  
  # Run the test
  uv run pytest tests/test_greeting.py -v
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the background, these commands are calling the build tools for each language and using a [Sandbox](./testing/integration-test.md) to test the contract.

:::tip Sandbox

Testing the contracts within a Sandbox allows you to understand how the contract will behave once deployed to the network while having total control over the testing environment.

:::

## Create a Testnet Account

Now that you know the contract is passing the tests, let's create a `testnet` account in which to deploy the contract. [`near-cli`](../tools/cli.md) supports two versions of some commands - full and short one. It's up to you which format you prefer, but full version provides more features.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

    ```bash
    # Replace <your-account-id.testnet> with a custom name
    near create-account <your-account-id.testnet> --useFaucet
    ```

    <details>
    <summary> Example Result </summary>

    ```bash
    $> near create-account lovely-event.testnet --useFaucet
    # New account "lovely-event.testnet" created successfully
    ```

    </details>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

    ```bash
    # Replace <your-account-id.testnet> with a custom name
    near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service <your-account-id.testnet> autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create
    ````

    <details>
    <summary> Example Result </summary>

    ```bash
    $> near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service lovely-event.testnet autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create

    # New account "lovely-event.testnet" created successfully
    ```

    </details>

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


:::tip

Remember that you can create a named account through any wallet (i.e. [MyNearWallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com)) and then use it from the `near-cli` by invoking `near login`.

:::

:::warning

When running the near account create-account command in a headless Linux environment (e.g., WSL), the `save-to-keychain` option may fail due to platform limitations. Use `save-to-legacy-keychain` instead of `save-to-keychain` to ensure compatibility.

:::

## Build the Contract

When you are ready to create a build of the contract run a one-line command depending on your environment.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="js" label="üåê JavaScript">

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">

  ```bash
  cargo near build
  ```

  
  :::info

  For this tutorial we will use the `non-reproducible-wasm` option when building the contract, but please know that you can create a reproducible build if you have `Docker` installed

  :::

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="py" label="üêç Python">

  ```bash
  # Build with nearc through the uv executor (no installation needed)
  uvx nearc build greeting_contract.py -o greeting_contract.wasm
  ```
  
  The above command will compile your Python contract into WebAssembly (WASM) that can be deployed to the NEAR blockchain.
  
  :::info
  
  The default nearc build configuration is appropriate for most contracts. You don't need to install nearc separately as we're using `uvx` to run it directly.
  
  :::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Deploy the Contract

Having our account created, we can now deploy the contract:

      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>

## Interacting with the Contract

To interact with your deployed smart contract, you can call its functions through the command line.

<hr class="subsection" />

#### Get Greeting
Let's start by fetching the greeting stored in the contract. The `get_greeting` function only reads from the contract's state, and can thus be called for **free**.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

    ```bash
    > near view <created-account> get_greeting
    # "Hello, NEAR world!"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

    ```bash
    > near contract call-function as-read-only <created-account> get_greeting json-args {} network-config testnet now
    # "Hello, NEAR world!"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr class="subsection" />

#### Set Greeting

We can now change the greeting stored in the contract. The `set_greeting` method writes on the contract's [storage](./anatomy/storage.md), and thus requires a user to sign a transaction in order to be executed.

<Tabs groupId="cli-tabs">
  <TabItem value="short" label="Short">

  ```bash
  > near call <created-account> set_greeting '{"message": "Hola"}' --accountId <created-account>
  # {"success": true}
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="full" label="Full">

    ```bash
    > near contract call-function as-transaction <created-account> set_greeting json-args '{"message": "Hola"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <created-account> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
    # {"success": true}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

Notice that we are signing the transaction using `<created-account>`, so in this case, we are asking the contract's account to call its own function

:::
