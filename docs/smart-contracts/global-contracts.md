Global contracts allow smart contracts to be deployed once and reused by any account without incurring high storage costs.

## Deploying a Global Contract

Global contracts can be deployed in 2 ways: either by their hash or by the owner account ID.
Contracts deployed by hash are effectively immutable and cannot be updated.
When deployed by account id the owner can redeploy the contract updating it for all its users.

Global contracts can be deployed using `NEAR CLI`.
The process is similar to [deploying a regular contract](./release/deploy.md#deploying-the-contract) but `deploy-as-global` command should be used instead of `deploy`.

:::info
Note that deploying a global contract incurs high storage costs. Tokens are burned to compensate for storing the contract on-chain, unlike regular contracts where tokens are locked based on contract size.

## Using a Global Contract

A previously deployed global contract can be attached to any NEAR account using `NEAR CLI` `deploy` command. Such a contract behaves exactly like a regular contract.
