# Reducing a contract's size

<Tabs className="language-tabs" groupId="code-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rust" label="🦀 Rust">

## Advice & examples

This page is made for developers familiar with lower-level concepts who wish to reduce their contract size significantly, perhaps at the expense of code readability.

Some common scenarios where this approach may be helpful:

- contracts intended to be tied to one's account management
- contracts deployed using a factory
- future advancements similar to the EVM on NEAR

There have been a few items that may add unwanted bytes to a contract's size when compiled. Some of these may be more easily swapped for other approaches while others require more internal knowledge about system calls.

## Small wins

### Using flags

When compiling a contract make sure to pass flag `-C link-arg=-s` to the rust compiler:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Here is the parameters we use for the most examples in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "s"
lto = true
debug = false
panic = "abort"
overflow-checks = true
```

You may want to experiment with using `opt-level = "z"` instead of `opt-level = "s"` to see if generates a smaller binary. See more details on this in [The Cargo Book Profiles section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#opt-level). You may also reference this [Shrinking .wasm Size](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/code-size.html#tell-llvm-to-optimize-for-size-instead-of-speed) resource.

### Removing `rlib` from the manifest

Ensure that your manifest (`Cargo.toml`) doesn't contain `rlib` unless it needs to. Some NEAR examples have included this:

:::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```
:::

  when it could be:

:::tip

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```
:::

3. When using the Rust SDK, you may override the default JSON serialization to use [Borsh](https://borsh.io) instead. [See this page](./serialization-interface.md#overriding-serialization-protocol-default) for more information and an example.
4. When using assertions or guards, avoid using the standard `assert` macros like [`assert!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert.html), [`assert_eq!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html), or [`assert_ne!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_ne.html) as these may add bloat for information regarding the line number of the error. There are similar issues with `unwrap`, `expect`, and Rust's `panic!()` macro.

  Example of a standard assertion:

  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

  ```rust
  assert_eq!(contract_owner, predecessor_account, "ERR_NOT_OWNER");
  ```
  :::

  when it could be:

  :::tip

  ```rust
  if contract_owner != predecessor_account {
    env::panic(b"ERR_NOT_OWNER");
  }
  ```
  :::

  Example of removing `expect`:

  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

  ```rust
  let owner_id = self.owner_by_id.get(&token_id).expect("Token not found");
  ```
  :::

  when it could be:

  :::tip

  ```rust
  fn expect_token_found<T>(option: Option<T>) -> T {
    option.unwrap_or_else(|| env::panic_str("Token not found"))
  }
  let owner_id = expect_token_found(self.owner_by_id.get(&token_id));  
  ```
  :::

  Example of changing standard `panic!()`:

  :::caution Adds unnecessary bloat

  ```rust
  panic!("ERR_MSG_HERE"); 
  ```
  :::

  when it could be:

  :::tip

  ```rust
  env::panic_str("ERR_MSG_HERE");  
  ```

## Ready to use script
We have prepared a simple `bash` script that can be used to minify `.wasm` contract file. You can find it [here](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/master/minifier/minify.sh).

The current approach to minification is the following:
1. Snip (i.e. just replace with unreachable instruction) few known fat functions from the standard library (such as float formatting and panic-related) with `wasm-snip`.
2. Run `wasm-gc` to eliminate all functions reachable from the snipped functions.
3. Strip unneeded sections, such as names with `wasm-strip`.
4. Run `binaryen wasm-opt`, which cleans up the rest.

### Requirements to run the script:
- install [wasm-snip](https://docs.rs/wasm-snip/0.4.0/wasm_snip/) and [wasm-gc](https://docs.rs/crate/wasm-gc/0.1.6) with Cargo:
```bash
cargo install wasm-snip wasm-gc
```
- install [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) and [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) on your system. For Ubuntu and other Debian based Linux distributions run:
```bash
apt install binaryen wabt
```

:::danger

Minification could be rather aggressive, so you must test the contract after minification. Standalone NEAR runtime could be helpful [here](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/tree/master/runtime/near-vm-runner).

## Lower-level approach

For a `no_std` approach to minimal contracts, observe the following examples:

- [Tiny contract](https://github.com/near/nearcore/tree/1e7c6613f65c23f87adf2c92e3d877f4ffe666ea/runtime/near-test-contracts/tiny-contract-rs)
- [NEAR ETH Gateway](https://github.com/ilblackdragon/near-eth-gateway/blob/master/proxy/src/lib.rs)
- [This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Hy4VBSCqnsE) where Eugene demonstrates a fungible token in `no_std` mode. The code for this [example lives here](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/pull/88).
- [Examples using a project called `nesdie`](https://github.com/austinabell/nesdie/tree/main/examples).
- Note that Aurora has found success using [rjson](https://crates.io/crates/rjson) as a lightweight JSON serialization crate. It has a smaller footprint than [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) which is currently packaged with the Rust SDK. See [this example of rjson](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/blob/65a1d11fcd16192cc1bda886c62005c603189a24/src/json.rs#L254) in an Aurora repository, although implementation details will have to be gleaned by the reader and won't be expanded upon here. [This nesdie example](https://github.com/austinabell/nesdie/blob/bb6beb77e32cd54077ac54bf028f262a9dfb6ad0/examples/multisig/src/utils/json/vector.rs#L26-L30) also uses the [miniserde crate](https://crates.io/crates/miniserde), which is another option to consider for folks who choose to avoid using the Rust SDK.

## Optimizing Python Contracts

Since Python smart contracts on NEAR are interpreted rather than compiled to WebAssembly directly, the optimization strategies differ from Rust contracts. The Python interpreter itself is already optimized, but you can still make your contract more efficient.

### Reducing Contract Size

#### 1. Minimize Dependencies

Only import the modules and functions you need:

```python
# Less efficient - imports everything
from near_sdk_py import *

# More efficient - imports only what's needed
from near_sdk_py import view, call, Context
```

#### 2. Use Efficient Data Structures

Choose the right data structure for your needs:

```python
# Less efficient for lookups
user_list = []  # O(n) lookup time
for user in user_list:
    if user["id"] == user_id:
        return user

# More efficient for lookups
user_dict = {}  # O(1) lookup time
if user_id in user_dict:
    return user_dict[user_id]
```

#### 3. Optimize Storage Usage

The NEAR SDK collections are optimized for on-chain storage. For large data sets, use these instead of native Python collections:

```python
# Native collection - loaded entirely into memory
self.users = {}  # Loaded entirely on each method call

# SDK collection - lazily loaded
from near_sdk_py.collections import UnorderedMap
self.users = UnorderedMap("u")  # Only loads what's needed
```

#### 4. Reduce String Operations

String operations can be expensive. Minimize them when possible:

```python
# Less efficient
result = ""
for i in range(100):
    result += str(i)  # Creates many intermediate strings

# More efficient
parts = []
for i in range(100):
    parts.append(str(i))
result = "".join(parts)  # Creates strings once
```

#### 5. Avoid Recursion

Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow issues. Consider iterative approaches instead:

```python
# Recursive - could cause issues with deep structures
def process_tree(node):
    result = process_node(node)
    for child in node.children:
        result += process_tree(child)
    return result

# Iterative - more efficient
def process_tree(root):
    result = 0
    queue = [root]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        result += process_node(node)
        queue.extend(node.children)
    return result
```

#### 6. Use Python's Built-in Functions

Python's built-in functions are often optimized and more efficient:

```python
# Less efficient
sum_value = 0
for num in numbers:
    sum_value += num

# More efficient
sum_value = sum(numbers)
```

#### 7. Split Complex Logic

If you have a very large contract, consider splitting it into multiple contracts with focused responsibilities. This can improve maintainability and reduce the cost of individual calls.

#### 8. Profile and Optimize Hot Paths

Focus optimization efforts on the most frequently called functions or those that handle large amounts of data:

```python
@call
def frequently_called_method(self, data):
    # Optimize this code carefully
    # Consider using more efficient algorithms and data structures
    pass
```
