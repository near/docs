A cross contract call happens when a smart contract invokes a method on another smart contract. This ability allows a developer to create complicated interactions by composing various smart contracts together. In order to make this composability easier for developers, NEAR introduces promises. Promises allow developers to synchronize cross contract calls using familiar `.then` syntax.

Since NEAR is a sharded blockchain, much of this is accomplished by something akin to the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). While making cross contract calls, we are sending messages (`ActionReceipt`) to other contracts. When the other contract finishes, they send back a message (`DataReceipt`) containing returned data. This returned data can be processed by registering a callback using the `.then` syntax.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- [Smart Contract Overview](/docs/develop/contracts/overview)
- [Rust Introduction](/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro)
- [AssemblyScript Introduction](/docs/develop/contracts/as/intro)

## Terminology {#terminology}

- **`Runtime`** - the layer responsible for running smart contracts. It converts transactions into receipts and processes receipts. [More info here](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Runtime)
- **`Receipt`** - messages passed between blocks. [More info here](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Receipts#receipt)
- **`ActionReceipt`** - a `Receipt` used to apply some actions to a receiver (such as apply a smart contract method). [More info here](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Receipts#actionreceipt)
- **`DataReceipt`** - represents the final contract execution result . [More info here](https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Receipts#datareceipt)

## Calling Smart Contract Methods {#calling-smart-contract-methods}

Since NEAR is a sharded blockchain, the runtime packages the call from `A` to `B` into an `ActionReceipt`. At the same time, the shard containing `A` registers a callback by creating a pending `ActionReceipt`. On the next block, the shard containing `B` will process the `ActionReceipt` from `A` invoking the method on `B`. It will then take the returned value from `B` and package it into a `DataReceipt`. Then, on the next block, the shard containing `A` will process the `DataReceipt` from `B` and trigger the pending `ActionReceipt` from earlier, invoking the registered callback.

1. Contract `A` calls contract `B`
2. The runtime prepares the cross contract call by:
   - creating an `ActionReceipt` to send to the shard containing `B`
   - creating a pending `ActionReceipt` that it stores locally
3. On the next block, the shard containing `B`:
   - processes the `ActionReceipt` invoking the method on `B`
   - takes the return value from `B` and packages it into a `DataReceipt`
4. On the next block, the shard containing `A` triggers the pending `ActionReceipt` with the data from `B`

## Common Patterns {#common-patterns}

### Callback Pattern {#callback-pattern}

The callback pattern is used when contract `A` calls contract `B` and wants to do something with the data returned from `B`. In the following example, Contract `B` is a Fungible Token contract. Contract `A` makes a cross contract call to contract `B` to check the balance of an account and registers a callback. If the cross contract call fails the callback returns `oops!`. If the cross contract call is successful and the balance is `> 100000` the callback returns `Wow!`, otherwise it returns `Hmmmm`.

### Event Pattern {#event-pattern}

The event pattern is used when a contract `EventPublisher` defines a method with an `event_subscriber_id` parameter. When that method is called, the `EventPublisher` makes a cross contract call to the `event_subscriber_id` smart contract invoking an event handler on that contract. For example, a `VotingContract` (EventPublisher) allows people to `candidate_vote_call` on a candidate. When a candidate is voted for the candidate's smart contract `candidate_on_vote` method (event handler) will be invoked.

When using the event pattern, there are some conventions to follow. On the `EventPublisher` method:

- prefixed with a contract identifier (e.g. `candidate_`, `ft_`, `nft_`)
- suffixed with `_call` (e.g. `candidate_vote_call`, `ft_transfer_call`, `nft_transfer_call`)

On the other side of the `EventPublisher` is an `EventSubscriber` contract. This contract has to define a predetermined method that will be invoked by a cross contract call from the `EventPublisher` contract. In the above code you'll notice that the `candidate_vote_call` method makes a cross contract call to a `candidate_on_vote` method. This `candidate_on_vote` method has to be defined by the `EventSubscriber` contract.

On the `EventSubscriber` method:

- prefixed with a contract identifier (e.g. `candidate_`, `ft_`, `nft_`)
- followed by `on` and then the name of the event it handles (e.g. `candidate_on_vote`, `ft_on_transfer`, `nft_on_transfer`)

## Common Use Cases {#common-use-cases}

Both the [Fungible Token Standard (NEP-141)](https://nomicon.io/Standards/FungibleToken/Core) and the [Non-Fungible Token Standard (NEP-171)](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core) make use of the Callback Pattern and the Event Pattern.

### Fungible Token Standard {#fungible-token-standard}

NEP-141 defines a `ft_transfer_call` method that transfers tokens from the sender to a receiver. As the name suggests, this method is an event publisher (`_call` is our clue). The receiver contract is expected to define a method, `ft_on_transfer`, which should return the number of unused tokens.

The `ft_transfer_call` method will make a cross contract call to the `ft_on_transfer` method, it will also register a callback, `ft_resolve_transfer`, that will take the unused tokens returned by `ft_on_transfer` and refund those tokens back to the sender.

### Non-Fungible Token Standard {#non-fungible-token-standard}

Similarly, the [Non-Fungible Token Standard (NEP-171)](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core) defines a method `nft_transfer_call`. Again, the name suggests that this is an event publisher (`_call` is our clue).

1. a sender invokes the `nft_transfer_call` method to send an NFT to a receiver
2. the `nft_transfer_call` method transfers the NFT from sender to receiver
3. after the transfer a cross contract call is started
   - an `ActionReceipt` is created to call the `nft_on_transfer` method on the receiver contract
   - a callback `nft_resolve_transfer` is registered by creating a pending `ActionReceipt`
4. on the next block, the `nft_on_transfer` method is executed on the receiver contract and a `DataReceipt` is created
5. on the next block, the pending `ActionReceipt` from above is ready and the `nft_resolve_transfer` callback is executed
