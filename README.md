<a href="https://discord.gg/gBtUFKR">![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/490367152054992913.svg)</a>

* ⚖️ NEAR Protocol is a new smart-contract platform that delivers scalability and usability.
* 🛠 Through sharding, it will linearly scale with the number of validation nodes on the network.
* 🗝 Leveraging WebAssembly (via Rust and AssemblyScript), more sane contract management, ephemeral accounts and many other advancements, NEAR
finally makes using a blockchain protocol easy for both developers and consumers.
