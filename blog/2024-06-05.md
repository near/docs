In this article, we will cover how to install WSL and setup a NEAR development environment on Windows.

<!-- truncate -->

### WSL

WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. It allows us to run a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

#### Enable WSL from `Windows Features`

`Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features on or off`  
Scrolling down will reveal the option `Windows Subsystem for Linux`. Make sure it is enabled and press OK to confirm (you will be asked to reboot your computer).

#### Start WSL and Install Ubuntu

Now we will spend some time in either `PowerShell` or [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal), which is a modern terminal application that supports various command-line tools and shells.

```
wsl --install --d Ubuntu
```

### Install Required Packages

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install gcc make libudev-dev openssl pkg-config unzip -y
```

:::tip Permission Denied?
Depending on your setup, you might need to run the commands with `sudo`. This temporarily grants your user elevated privileges to perform tasks that require higher permissions.

### Setup Developer Environment

Now that we have WSL enabled and running Ubuntu, NEAR currently supports two SDKs ([JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-js) and [Rust](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs)). Their requirements are different, but we can install both if we choose.

#### Node (JS/TS)

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes code outside a web browser, enabling the development of server-side applications. In NEAR development, it can be used to write smart contracts in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

```
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
# download and install Node.js
nvm install 20
# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v20.14.0`
# verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.7.0`
```

#### Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a programming language known for its safety and performance. It's used in NEAR development to write secure and efficient smart contracts.

Next, we need to add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain. This toolchain is required because the contracts we build will be compiled to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) to run on the NEAR blockchain.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# When prompted, press enter for default install options
. source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### That's It

At this point, we are ready to install the relevant tooling and start building on NEAR. Head over to the [Quick Start](http://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/quickstart) section of the docs for more information or jump right into the [examples](https://github.com/near-examples).
