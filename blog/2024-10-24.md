You might have noticed that a [new tutorial](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/auction/introduction) has been added to the docs! This multi-part series is all about learning to build full applications on NEAR; you will see how to build an on-chain auction from start to finish, including the smart contract, deploying it on-chain, and creating a frontend to interact with it.

<!-- truncate -->

Along the way you will learn several key concepts and how to use many key primitives along the way: 
- Creating a simple smart contract
- Writing tests for a contract
- Deploying a contract to testnet
- Locking a contract
- Creating a frontend to interact with the contract
- Using an indexing API to view historical bids
- Making cross-contract calls
- Using Non-Fungible Tokens
- Using Fungible Tokens
- Modifying a factory contract to deploy your own contracts

This tutorial is a great for beginners to follow all the way through, but each section can also be used as a reference guide for different concepts. If you have any feedback or any questions regarding the tutorial please feel free to reach out in the [Developer Telegram Channel](https://t.me/neardev).
