## Understanding Finality in Blockchain

When you send a transaction on a blockchain, how long does it take to be truly final? This question is critical for developers building applications, especially those requiring fast confirmations like payments, gaming, or DeFi.

There are two main types of finality:

- **Soft Finality (Optimistic)**: The transaction is included in a block and is unlikely to be reversed, but there's still a small chance of reorganization
- **Hard Finality**: The transaction is irreversibly committed to the blockchain with cryptographic guarantees

## The Benchmark

We sent **30 transactions** to each network and measured the time to finality. Here are the networks we tested:

- **NEAR Protocol**
- **Aptos**
- **Arbitrum**
- **Ethereum Sepolia**
- **Solana**
- **Sui**

For each network, we measured both optimistic and final confirmation times.

## Results

### NEAR Protocol

*NEAR's hard finality distribution*

*NEAR's soft finality distribution*

NEAR demonstrated **consistently fast hard finality**, with most transactions achieving finality in around 3.3 seconds. The optimistic confirmations were faster, typically completing in around 2.3 seconds.

### Aptos

*Aptos hard finality distribution*

![Aptos Optimistic Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_aptos-optimistic-2025-12-12T01-08-00-916Z.png)
*Aptos soft finality distribution*

Aptos showed excellent performance with both optimistic and hard finality, with hard finality typically achieved in around 0.6 seconds and optimistic confirmations in around 0.2 seconds.

### Arbitrum

![Arbitrum Final Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_arbitrum-final-2025-12-13T14-58-02-449Z.png)
*Arbitrum hard finality distribution*

![Arbitrum Optimistic Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_arbitrum-optimistic-2025-12-11T14-23-25-412Z.png)
*Arbitrum soft finality distribution*

As a Layer 2 solution, Arbitrum's optimistic confirmations were fast, but hard finality can take much longer due to its reliance on Ethereum's finality.

### Ethereum Sepolia

*Ethereum Sepolia hard finality distribution*

![Ethereum Sepolia Optimistic Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_sepolia-optimistic-2025-12-12T01-56-29-521Z.png)
*Ethereum Sepolia optimistic finality distribution*

Ethereum (testnet) showed the longest finality times, typically ranging from 12-15 minutes for hard finality, as expected with its proof-of-stake consensus requiring multiple epochs. Even optimistic confirmations on Ethereum are significantly slower compared to other chains.

### Solana

![Solana Final Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_solana-final-2025-12-05T00-28-01-516Z.png)
*Solana hard finality distribution*

![Solana Optimistic Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_solana-optimistic-2025-12-10T22-17-47-627Z.png)
*Solana soft finality distribution*

Solana excelled at optimistic finality with sub-second confirmations (around 0.9 seconds), but hard finality took longer, typically around 13 seconds.

### Sui

![Sui Final Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_sui-final-2025-12-05T00-17-44-688Z.png)
*Sui hard finality distribution*

![Sui Optimistic Finality](/assets/blog/2025-benchmark/histogram_sui-optimistic-2025-12-10T22-16-01-217Z.png)
*Sui soft finality distribution*

Sui demonstrated competitive performance with both optimistic and final confirmations, with hard finality typically achieved in around 3 seconds and optimistic confirmations in around 1.5 seconds.

## Why Fast Hard Finality Matters

The benchmark reveals that **chains like NEAR and Aptos offer consistently fast hard finality**, which is particularly important for:

1. **Cross-Chain Applications**: When building chain-abstracted applications, you need reliable finality guarantees across chains
2. **Payment Systems**: Fast hard finality means users don't need to wait long for irreversible confirmations
3. **DeFi Protocols**: Reduced settlement times mean less exposure to price volatility
4. **Better UX**: Users get faster feedback without sacrificing security

## The Trade-offs

While many chains can achieve fast optimistic finality, the gap between soft and hard finality varies significantly:

- **Aptos**: Very small gap (~0.4 seconds difference)
- **NEAR**: Small gap (~1 second difference)
- **Sui**: Small gap (~1.5 seconds difference)
- **Solana**: Large gap (~12 seconds difference)
- **Arbitrum**: Very large gap (minutes to hours difference)
- **Ethereum**: Long finality by design (~12-15 minutes)

## Resources

The complete benchmark data and analysis tools are open source and available on GitHub:

- **Network Analyzer**: [matiasbenary/networksAnalizer](https://github.com/matiasbenary/networksAnalizer) - Tool used to measure and analyze finality across different networks

## Conclusion

Our benchmark of 30 transactions across six networks shows that **not all blockchains are created equal when it comes to finality**. While optimistic confirmations can be fast on many chains, there are significant differences in hard finality performance:

- **Aptos** leads with the fastest hard finality (~0.6 seconds)
- **Sui** offers strong performance with hard finality in ~3 seconds
- **NEAR** delivers reliable hard finality in ~3.3 seconds
- **Solana** shows excellent optimistic finality but slower hard finality (~13 seconds)
- **Arbitrum** and **Ethereum** have significantly longer finality times

For developers building applications that require reliable, fast transaction confirmations, these finality characteristics should be a key consideration when choosing a blockchain platform.
