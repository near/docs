*While each has its own theoretical finality, an important question for devs is "how long does it *actually* take for my app that a transaction is final". In this post, we send transactions across 6 different chains and waited for them to be final to compare them empirically*

## Understanding Finality in Blockchain

When you send a transaction on a blockchain, how long does it take to be truly final? This question is critical for developers building applications, especially those requiring fast confirmations like payments, gaming, or DeFi.

There are two main types of finality:

- **Soft Finality (Optimistic)**: The transaction is included in a block and is *unlikely* to be reversed, but there's still a small chance of reorganization
- **Hard Finality**: The transaction is irreversibly committed to the blockchain with cryptographic guarantees


For example, here are the **theoretical finality times** for 6 popular blockchains:

| Blockchain       | Optimistic Finality | Hard Finality                                                                                                |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NEAR Protocol    | 600ms               | [1.2 seconds](https://pages.near.org/blog/blink-and-its-final-near-launches-600ms-blocks-and-1-2s-finality/) |
| Aptos            |                     |                                                                                                              |
| Arbitrum         |                     |                                                                                                              |
| Ethereum Sepolia |                     |                                                                                                              |
| Solana           |                     |                                                                                                              |
| Sui              |                     |                                                                                                              |

## Real-World Performance Benchmark

Despite what the theoretical numbers say, real-world performance can differ due to network conditions, node performance, and other factors. To get a clearer picture, we conducted a benchmark test across six different blockchains.

To put this to the test, we built simple benchmarking scripts which make 30 transactions on each network, and lock to see how long it takes for both optimistic and hard finality. 

To be as fair as possible, we:

- used testnet networks on all chains
- made a simple transfer of native tokens to avoid complexities of smart contracts
- used free and public RPC endpoints

## What Does Optimistic Finality Actually Mean?

It is important to remark that there is not a single definition on what optimistic finality means, and it can vary between blockchains.

On NEAR Protocol, we are waiting for `executed optimistic` which is reached after the
transaction is [included in a block, and its first receipt is executed](https://docs.near.org/protocol/transaction-execution#final-block-gas-is-refunded)
(in the block thereafter). At that point, the protocol ensures that the transaction will not be reverted except if the block producer is slashed.

## Results

Here is a summary of the average finality times observed during our benchmark:

| Blockchain       | Optimistic Finality | Hard Finality |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| NEAR Protocol    | mean +/ std         |               |
| Aptos            |                     |               |
| Arbitrum         |                     |               |
| Ethereum Sepolia |                     |               |
| Solana           |                     |               |
| Sui              |                     |               |
