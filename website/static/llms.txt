# NEAR Protocol Documentation

## Overview
NEAR is a blockchain platform designed for building scalable, user-friendly decentralized applications. This documentation provides comprehensive guides for developers building on NEAR.

## Primary Resources

### Getting Started
- **Smart Contracts Quickstart**: /smart-contracts/quickstart
  Create your first NEAR smart contract in JavaScript, Rust, Python, or Go. Includes setup, testing, deployment.

- **Web3 Apps Quickstart**: /web3-apps/quickstart
  Build a frontend application with NEAR wallet integration. React/Next.js example with wallet login and contract interaction.

### Core Concepts
- **Account Model**: /protocol/account-model
  NEAR uses human-readable account IDs. Accounts can store smart contracts, hold tokens, and have access keys.

- **Smart Contracts**: /smart-contracts/anatomy/basic-anatomy
  Contracts are small programs stored on accounts. Write in JavaScript, Rust, Python, or Go. Compiled to WebAssembly.

- **Access Keys**: /protocol/access-keys
  Two types: Full Access (complete control) and Function Call (limited permissions for dApp UX).

### Chain Abstraction
- **Chain Signatures**: /chain-abstraction/chain-signatures/getting-started
  Control addresses on other blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) from NEAR accounts using MPC signatures.

- **Intents**: /chain-abstraction/intents
  User-centric transaction model where users declare desired outcomes, not step-by-step instructions.

### AI Integration
- **NEAR AI**: /ai/introduction
  Build AI agents that can execute on-chain actions, manage wallets, and interact with smart contracts.

- **Shade Agents**: /ai/shade-agents/getting-started/introduction
  Framework for creating autonomous AI agents with on-chain identity and capabilities.

### Developer Tools
- **NEAR CLI**: /tools/cli
  Command-line interface for deploying contracts, managing accounts, calling functions.

- **Wallet Selector**: /tools/wallet-selector
  Modal for users to choose their preferred NEAR wallet (MyNearWallet, Meteor, etc.).

- **Ethereum Wallets**: /web3-apps/tutorials/web-login/ethereum-wallets
  Connect Metamask and other EVM wallets to NEAR apps.

### Data & Indexing
- **NEAR Lake**: /data-infrastructure/near-lake-framework
  Stream blockchain data in real-time. Subscribe to on-chain events.

- **BigQuery**: /data-infrastructure/big-query
  Query historical NEAR blockchain data using SQL.

### Primitives
- **NFTs**: /primitives/nft/nft
  NEAR NFT standard (NEP-171). Mint, transfer, and manage non-fungible tokens.

- **Fungible Tokens**: /primitives/ft
  NEAR FT standard (NEP-141). Create and manage tokens.

## Key Differences from Other Blockchains

- **Human-readable accounts**: Use `alice.near` instead of `0x123...abc`
- **Progressive gas fees**: Users can get function-call access keys to sign non-payable transactions without wallet prompts
- **Built-in account abstraction**: No need for separate AA solutions
- **Native chain abstraction**: Control other chains' addresses from NEAR accounts
- **Sharded architecture**: Scales horizontally (not just layer-2s)

## Common Developer Questions

**How do I deploy a contract?**
Use `near deploy <account-id> <wasm-file>` via NEAR CLI.

**Which language should I use?**
JavaScript/TypeScript for rapid prototyping, Rust for production, Python/Go for specific use cases.

**How do I test contracts?**
NEAR provides sandbox testing environments. Run `npm test` (JS), `cargo test` (Rust), or `uv run pytest` (Python).

**What's a function-call access key?**
Limited permission key that can only call specific contract methods. Enables wallet-less UX for users.

**How do I integrate wallet login?**
Use @near-wallet-selector/core package. Supports multiple wallets in a single modal.

**Can I connect Ethereum wallets?**
Yes, NEAR supports Metamask and other EVM wallets through chain signatures.
