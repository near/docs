Linkdrops are an easy way to distribute blockchain items (NFTs, FTs) via links. You provide a link for user and they can claim your drop.

This section provides some examples how to create different linkdrops from [a NEAR component](./interacting/bos.md), [web app](./interacting/web-app.md) and [near-cli](./interacting/near-cli.md).

:::note
In this section we will use as reference the [Keypom implementation](https://keypom.xyz/).
