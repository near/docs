<p>After many discussions with NEAR’s B.O.S. component developers and careful consideration, Pagoda has decided to discontinue its active development for <a href="https://github.com/near/bos-web-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B.O.S. Web Engine R&amp;D </a>for an improved execution layer for NEAR B.O.S. Components. (also known as “BWE” &amp; “VM2”)</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#background">​</a></h2>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-announces-the-blockchain-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAR introduced the Blockchain Operating System</a>, demonstrating how NEAR’s performant tech stack could support a full-stack decentralized development platform that was multi-chain compatible. A core feature of this system consisted of composable decentralized front-ends (B.O.S. Components) paired with a user-centric data storage contract (social-db). This model, <a href="https://thewiki.near.page/PastPresentAndFutureOfNearSocial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pioneered by NEAR Social</a>, aimed to continue NEAR’s mission of empowering users to own their data as well as eliminate reliance on centralized, single-entity-controlled web applications. The potential of a fully decentralized web and the creation of real dApps became closer to reality with these inherently open and customizable experiences.</p>
<p>As the community started to adopt B.O.S. it soon became clear that, while devs loved how fast it was to go from an idea to a product, its intrinsic technical limitations made it hard to use B.O.S. for any real-world application. This consistent feedback from multiple members of the community prompted Pagoda to start an R&amp;D effort to improve B.O.S. such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was as close to vanilla React as possible</li>
<li>Supported npm package imports</li>
<li>Unlocked multi-chain scalability limitations</li>
<li>Improved performance</li>
<li>Improved security</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bos-web-engine">B.O.S. Web Engine<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to B.O.S. Web Engine" title="Direct link to B.O.S. Web Engine" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#bos-web-engine">​</a></h2>
<p>In order to act on this feedback and accomplish these goals, improvements had to be made to the execution layer that makes this all possible. At its core, a virtual machine, (<a href="https://github.com/NearSocial/VM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAR Social VM</a>) renders front-end code that developers store in a smart contract onchain (social-db). It was determined that a new approach to the original VM solution was needed, and the B.O.S. Web Engine project was created. Countless hours of hard work and dedication have gone into this project, yielding many significant achievements along the way. However, one major challenge still stands in the way of a production-ready beta release: expanding support for npm packages, particularly UI libraries.</p>
<p>During the alpha testing phase of this project, we anticipated a fairly straightforward path in resolving wider npm support but unfortunately, the team discovered a more complex scenario. While standard JavaScript packages work well, React UI libraries frequently encounter difficulties. These challenges stem from the unique packaging methods of each library and the complexities involved in synchronizing changes between the iframe and the outer DOM. Although we have identified several theoretical solutions, each requires further research and development to assess their practicality and effectiveness. This has been more fully detailed in <a href="https://github.com/near/react-on-chain/discussions/425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a GitHub discussion within the BWE Repo</a>.</p>
<p>We reached out to leading B.O.S. component contributors to determine whether this limitation would be unnegotiable and to learn what features they value most. Do they prioritize unrestricted NPM support over secure iframe composability? How important is composability, and how would they define it? (considering our approach dissects it down to the atomic level of every element)</p>
<p>This revealed some interesting findings, one of which was that secure composability on an atomic level was not at the top of the list. Most favored the ease of quick prototyping, deployment, and onboarding with managed infra and wallet connections. Many valued social-db features and the ability to create custom gateways (websites) using code and user data publicly available to them.</p>
<p>In short, there were three camps:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="true-believers">True Believers<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to True Believers" title="Direct link to True Believers" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#true-believers">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Decentralize all the things!</li>
<li>Love bleeding-edge unique tech</li>
<li>Love inherent open-source</li>
<li>Love social-db and its features</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quick-builders">Quick Builders<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quick Builders" title="Direct link to Quick Builders" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#quick-builders">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Love the speed of development, prototyping, remixing</li>
<li>Love reverse engineering existing components</li>
<li>Quick onboarding with managed infra and wallet connections</li>
<li>Great for hackathons</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="detractors">Detractors<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Detractors" title="Direct link to Detractors" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#detractors">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't like anything about B.O.S. components</li>
<li>DevX is poor and UI is slow</li>
<li>Value convenience over decentralization</li>
</ul>
<p>After reviewing our findings and engaging extensively with developers using this platform, it became clear that continuing with the release of the B.O.S. web engine as currently planned could potentially have a net negative impact. The majority of developers indicated that they do not favor a version of the BWE with limited npm support, even if it means enhanced secure composability. Additionally, while a minority of builders prioritize decentralization over performance and convenience, those who truly value decentralized frontends might find simpler ways to achieve their objectives once the need for secure composability is eliminated.</p>
<p>For those who may disagree with this perspective, the B.O.S. Web Engine remains, and will always be an open-source project. Anyone who sees value in the work we have done and wishes to advance this initiative is welcome to carry this torch and continue the development. <a href="https://github.com/near/bos-web-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/near/bos-web-engine</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-this-mean-for-bos-components--the-current-vm">What does this mean for B.O.S. components &amp; the current VM?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does this mean for B.O.S. components &amp; the current VM?" title="Direct link to What does this mean for B.O.S. components &amp; the current VM?" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#what-does-this-mean-for-bos-components--the-current-vm">​</a></h2>
<p>During the development of the B.O.S. Web Engine, a large focus was placed on addressing the security aspects of the existing VM and B.O.S. component architecture. The primary concern is with the composability and attack vectors that are exposed when importing components authored by third parties. Despite numerous patches to address discovered exploits, the inherent complexities of JavaScript and the current VM’s architecture suggest that such vulnerabilities may continue to persist. Pagoda has diligently monitored and addressed these issues to date but we anticipate challenges in continuing to proactively discover and mitigate future vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><em>For examples of previously discovered vulnerabilities, view the <a href="https://github.com/NearSocial/VM/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VM changelog</a> going back to <code>v2.5.1</code>, paying attention to lines tagged as <code>FIX</code> on issues Reported by <code>BrunoModificato</code> from OtterSec.</em></p>
<p>If you find value in creating B.O.S. components and leveraging the features of the social-db smart contract, rest assured that this framework will remain open-source and permanently accessible on-chain. However, we urge caution when incorporating and using third-party components. Due to the current virtual machine's limitations, we cannot guarantee protection against potential future exploits.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="should-i-migrate-my-project-off-of-bos">Should I migrate my project off of B.O.S.?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Should I migrate my project off of B.O.S.?" title="Direct link to Should I migrate my project off of B.O.S.?" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/bos-web-engine-sunset#should-i-migrate-my-project-off-of-bos">​</a></h2>
<p>If your application relies on community-contributed or unreviewed third-party components, then <strong>yes</strong>. As described above, we cannot guarantee protection against future security vulnerabilities in the VM and B.O.S. component architecture. However, you can mitigate (but not eliminate) these security risks by reviewing all third-party components and either forking them or locking down dependencies to the specific version that you reviewed.</p>
<p>If you are not relying on any untrusted component code, then <strong>maybe</strong>. You are not being forced to migrate and there are still teams actively building new applications leveraging B.O.S. Additionally, there are no plans to deprecate main B.O.S. gateways at <a href="https://dev.near.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev.near.org</a>, <a href="https://near.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near.social</a>, or <a href="https://bos.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bos.gg</a>. However, the underlying framework and virtual machine are no longer actively developed or maintained by the original team. Consequently, the pace at which new features are introduced and existing bugs or vulnerabilities are addressed may be slower than expected. We openly welcome new maintainers for <a href="https://github.com/nearsocial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this codebase</a>. However, as previously mentioned, we anticipate that additional security vulnerabilities may still be discovered.</p>

<p>Smart contracts are small pieces of logic that can live on every NEAR account. To build a contract you use the NEAR SDKs, which comes in two flavours: Rust and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Until today, we had multiple docs explaining how to build smart contracts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/sdk/rust</code> dedicated to explain how to use the Rust SDK</li>
<li><code>/sdk/js</code> dedicated to explain how to use the JS SDK</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/smart-contracts/what-is"><code>/build/smart-contracts/what-is</code></a> - that explains general concepts, and how to implement them using both SDKs</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, this is over, as all the information on how to build smart contracts is located in a single area: <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/smart-contracts/what-is"><code>/build/smart-contracts/what-is</code></a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have transformed the <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/tools/sdk">SDK page</a> to be a simple landing page with links to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust SDK reference docs</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://near.github.io/near-api-js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JS SDK reference docs</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/smart-contracts/what-is">Smart Contract Section</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-did-we-have-3-sections-explaining-the-same-topic">Why did we have 3 sections explaining the same topic?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did we have 3 sections explaining the same topic?" title="Direct link to Why did we have 3 sections explaining the same topic?" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/sdks-unified#why-did-we-have-3-sections-explaining-the-same-topic">​</a></h2>
<p>The reason we had 3 different sections was that, historically, the engineers of each SDK were working on their own docs in isolation. To help mitigate this, we created a section on NEAR docs, meant to consolidate all the external documentation.</p>
<p>One day, the individual SDK pages were deleted - if I remember correctly, it was because we wanted to have fewer domains - and we had to migrate everything in a rush.</p>
<p>This left us in a very weird situation: we already had a section explaining how to build a smart contract... and now we had 3.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-single-source-of-truth">A single source of truth<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A single source of truth" title="Direct link to A single source of truth" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/sdks-unified#a-single-source-of-truth">​</a></h2>
<p>Luckily, this is now fixed! We have finally conquered the original dream of having a single section for <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/smart-contracts/what-is">Smart Contracts</a>, with all the information consolidated in there.</p>
<p>Now, we can focus on maintaining a single section, thus making it easier to keep it updated and relevant.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What's next?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's next?" title="Direct link to What's next?" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/sdks-unified#whats-next">​</a></h2>
<p>We are currently undergoing a process of <strong>consolidating</strong> all the documentation. This means that we are looking at all the sections that have overlapping information, and trying to merge them into a single place.</p>
<p>This will not only improve the quality of our docs, but also make it easier for you to find the information you need. In fact, improving search is one of the main motors of this change, since we noticed that our search tool (<a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algolia</a>) gets confused when the same concept is spread all over the place.</p>
<p>Moreover, having consistent and coherent documentation will allow us to further expand our search capabilities using AI! This is something we are very excited about, as it will allow us to provide you with even more relevant information.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="if-you-dont-like-this-change-please-let-us-know">If you don't like this change, please let us know!<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to If you don't like this change, please let us know!" title="Direct link to If you don't like this change, please let us know!" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/sdks-unified#if-you-dont-like-this-change-please-let-us-know">​</a></h2>
<p>As always, we are more than open to feedback. If you think that this change is not good, or that we are missing something, please let us know! You can reach out to us through the blue feedback button you see at the side of the screen.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback, and hope you enjoy the content we'll be sharing.</p>
<p>Happy coding, and see you in the next post! 🚀</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we will cover how to install WSL and setup a NEAR development environment on Windows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wsl">WSL<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to WSL" title="Direct link to WSL" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/getting-started-on-windows#wsl">​</a></h3>
<p>WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. It allows us to run a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enable-wsl-from-windows-features">Enable WSL from <code>Windows Features</code><a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to enable-wsl-from-windows-features" title="Direct link to enable-wsl-from-windows-features" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/getting-started-on-windows#enable-wsl-from-windows-features">​</a></h4>
<p>First of all, make sure that WSL is enabled, for this go to:
<code>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Turn Windows Features on or off</code>
Scrolling down will reveal the option <code>Windows Subsystem for Linux</code>. Make sure it is enabled and press OK to confirm (you will be asked to reboot your computer).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Windows Features WSL Enabled" src="https://docs.near.org/ko/assets/images/windows-features-wsl-enabled-a1476cedd8df0e961ba21dd9af59374a.jpg" width="908" height="792" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Now that we have WSL enabled and running Ubuntu, it is time to setup our developer environment. At NEAR we currently support using JS/TS and Rust to develop smart contracts, and JS/TS to develop web applications.</p>
<p>Bellow we will explain how to install both <code>Node.js</code> and <code>Rust</code>. If you want, you can install only one of them (e.g. if you are only planning to create a Rust contract, you don't need Node.js). However, we do recommend to install both so your environment is ready if you want to try something different later.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="node-jsts">Node (JS/TS)<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Node (JS/TS)" title="Direct link to Node (JS/TS)" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/getting-started-on-windows#node-jsts">​</a></h4>
<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes code outside a web browser, enabling the development of server-side applications. In NEAR development, it can be used to write smart contracts in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a>, as well as to create Web applications that interact with NEAR.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>dary! Legendary! NEAR protocol is getting updated with the ability to yield and resume computations</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="waiting on a loop" src="https://docs.near.org/ko/assets/images/legendary-c6675258ceadd49e3a9be41e3681b136.jpg" width="798" height="347" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-of-waiting">The problem of waiting<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem of waiting" title="Direct link to The problem of waiting" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/yield-resume#the-problem-of-waiting">​</a></h2>
<p>Currently, smart contracts have no way to wait for an external event to happen. This can be a problem when the contract relies on an external service to provide a result.</p>
<p>We encountered this issue while implementing <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures">Chain Signatures</a>, which work by requiring an external service to provide a signature.</p>
<p>Until now, the only workaround has been to make the contract call itself in a loop, checking on each iteration if the result is ready. Each call delays the result by one block (~1 second), allowing the contract to wait almost a minute before running out of gas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="waiting on a loop" src="https://docs.near.org/ko/assets/images/contract-wait-loop-c7b128ab1982ad80e9f40a7dfe4ddaea.png" width="1346" height="842" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Until now, contracts had to wait by calling themselves until a external service replies... more often than not the contract will run out of gas waiting</em></p>
<p>While this method works, it's far from ideal. It wastes a lot of gas on looping and - more often than not - runs out of gas, forcing the user to retry the transaction.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yield-and-resume">Yield and Resume<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Yield and Resume" title="Direct link to Yield and Resume" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/yield-resume#yield-and-resume">​</a></h2>
<p>Starting from version <code>1.40</code> of the protocol, developers can <strong>delay the execution</strong> of a function until certain conditions are met (e.g. an external service provides a result).</p>
<p>This way, instead of the contract calling itself on a loop waiting, the contract can simply <strong>yield</strong> calling the function that gives the result. When an external response is provided, the contract will <strong>resume</strong> and return the result.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="waiting on a yield" src="https://docs.near.org/ko/assets/images/contract-wait-yield-6820c700955fe4e6942fb9fdc619aa77.png" width="1355" height="842" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Contracts can now yield the execution of a function until an external service signals that the result is ready</em></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-exactly-being-yielded">What is exactly being yielded?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is exactly being yielded?" title="Direct link to What is exactly being yielded?" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/yield-resume#what-is-exactly-being-yielded">​</a></h3>
<p>It is important to notice that the contract is not <strong>halting</strong> or <strong>blocking</strong> its ability to execute, nor <strong>halting in the middle of a function</strong> to later resume it.</p>
<p>In the same way that a function can return a promise to call another contract, now a function can return a <strong>yield</strong> to call another function.</p>
<p>Indeed, the contract is not halting, but simply <strong>delaying the execution of a callback</strong> until an external agent signals that it is ok to resume.</p>
<p>If the contract does not trigger a resume after 200 blocks - around 4 minutes - the yielded function will resume receiving a "timeout error" as input.</p>

<p>Between the <code>yield</code> and <code>resume</code> the user will simply be waiting to receive the result. But, in contrast with waiting on a loop, the user will not pay GAS just for having the contract waiting!</p>

<p>While we have not created any official <code>yield/resume</code> example, you can refer to <a href="https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/pull/1133/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saketh Are's example</a>, who has been working on the <code>yield/resume</code> implementation.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the SDK now exposes two functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>yield(function_to_yield)</code> that returns a <code>yield_ID</code> which identifies the yield</li>
<li>A <code>resume(yield_ID)</code> that signals which instance of <code>function_to_yield</code> can now execute</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to <code>yield</code> and <code>resume</code> computations is a big step forward for the NEAR protocol, as it enables developers to create contracts that rely on external services.</p>
<p>Currently, the feature is only <strong>available on testnet</strong>, and we are looking for feedback on how to improve it.</p>
<p>We expect to have a more user-friendly way to use <code>yield</code> and <code>resume</code> in the future, so stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="organic-growth">Organic growth<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Organic growth" title="Direct link to Organic growth" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/reorganizing-docs#organic-growth">​</a></h2>
<p>Our documentation is the result of multiple people collaborating across the span of four very active years, and it has seen a lot of changes: <a href="https://github.com/near/docs/commits/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2942 commits and counting</a>.</p>
<p>In the beginning, our docs only needed to explain how to create <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/smart-contracts/what-is">smart contracts</a>, and how to <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/web3-apps/quickstart">interact with them through a frontend</a>. Fast forward to today, and we have more than 200 pages of documentation, covering topics such as <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/chain-abstraction/what-is">chain abstraction</a>, <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/near-components/what-is">on-chain components</a>, <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/data-infrastructure/what-is">data infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://docs.near.org/ko/build/primitives/what-is">primitives such as NFT, FT</a>.</p>
<p>The best thing is that new features are released every single month. However, all progress comes at a cost, and as our ecosystem grew, so did the disorganization of our documentation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-link-was-that-again">What link was that again?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What link was that again?" title="Direct link to What link was that again?" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/reorganizing-docs#what-link-was-that-again">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's briefly explain how <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docusaurus</a> (the framework we use in our docs) works so you can understand the problem.</p>
<p>In docusaurus, all the pages are written as simple markdown files. These files go inside the <code>./docs</code> folder, and can be organized in folders. Each file has a unique ID on its header that identifies it (e.g. <code>id: what-is</code>), and this ID, alongside its folder path, is used to generate the URL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the document <a href="https://github.com/near/docs/blob/master/docs/2.build/2.smart-contracts/what-is.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>docs/build/smart-contracts/what-is.md</code></a> has the <code>id: what-is</code>, so it ends being served in the URL <a href="https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/what-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/what-is</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The problem<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem" title="Direct link to The problem" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/reorganizing-docs#the-problem">​</a></h3>
<p>About a year ago, we noticed that our organic growth had left us with a very inconsistent URL structure. Basically, we had a lot of folders, and the files related to the same topic (e.g. NEAR components) would be all over the place.</p>
<p>For example, you would be in the "Build" section reading about "What is a NEAR Component?" and the URL was <code>/bos/tutorial/quickstart</code>. The next page was "Setup an Environment" located at <code>/bos/dev/intro</code>, followed by "Anatomy of a Component -&gt; State" at <code>/bos/api/state</code>. Talk about consistency!</p>
<p>Of course, we did not do this on purpose, it is just how things evolved. You might even notice that we are now talking about "NEAR Components" but the URL talks about "BOS". This is because when we started, "BOS" (Blockchain Operating System) felt like a good name, but community feedback made us know that, indeed, it was not.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-migration">The migration<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The migration" title="Direct link to The migration" href="https://docs.near.org/ko/blog/reorganizing-docs#the-migration">​</a></h3>
<p>We <a href="https://github.com/near/docs/pull/1890/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-organized more than 200 files</a> to a new structure that is more consistent. This makes it easier for users to remember the URLs, improves our SEO, and makes it easier for contributors to find where to add new content. No more need to search across multiple folders trying to find the right file!</p>
<p>In the process, we updated all <strong>internal links</strong>, aided by our <a href="https://github.com/near/docs/blob/master/website/test-links.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link-checker script</a> to make sure we left <strong>no broken links</strong>. We also added <strong>URL redirects</strong> in our server, so all users coming from an external site are redirected to the correct URLs.</p>
<p>Besides checking broken links, we took the time to make sure all the <strong>translations were correctly migrated</strong>. The system Docusaurus uses (called <a href="https://crowdin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crowdin</a>) is not very good at detecting changes in a file, so migrating all the translations was a huge effort in itself.</p>
<p>We could write a blog post just about migrating translations in docusaurus + crowdin... but we will spare you the pain.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new NEAR documentation blog! We're excited to inaugurate this new space where we can share news and updates. We know what you are thinking — why a blog? Well, it allows us to interact with you in a different way!</p>
<p>When writing documentation, it is important for us to keep the content focused and concise. This way, when you read it, you have nothing to distract you, and you can focus on learning a new concept.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that many times, we want to share ideas, thoughts, or insights into why some things are the way they are. However, this would imply going off on a tangent and explaining why some decisions were made, which will probably add noise to the document. Most of the time, users just want a link to an example or working code. Also, people don't like to read long texts.</p>
<p>Besides that, sometimes we just want to share what we did during the week. For example, did you notice that we fixed the nightmare that was the URL structure, or that we added new landing pages for all concepts? We want to share these things with you, but they don't really belong in the Docs.</p>

<p>We will be using this space to share updates about our docs, as well as <strong>complement them</strong> with additional information that we think you'll find interesting.</p>
<p>Our aim is to keep the blog updated at least once a week, but given the limited amount of time we have, we will see how that goes.</p>
<p>Moreover, we want to remind you that our Docs are an open source and <strong>collaborative project</strong>. If you feel like you have something to share, or want to contribute to the blog, feel free to reach out. And by reaching out, we mean <a href="https://github.com/near/docs/pulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening a PR</a>!</p>
