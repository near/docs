## Transaction Execution Levels {#tx-status-result}

All the methods listed above have `wait_until` request parameter, and
`final_execution_status` response value. They correspond to the same enum
`TxExecutionStatus`. See the detailed explanation for all the options:

```rust
#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]
pub enum TxExecutionStatus {
  /// Transaction is waiting to be included into the block
  None,
  /// Transaction is included into the block. The block may be not finalized yet
  Included,
  /// Transaction is included into the block +
  /// All non-refund transaction receipts finished their execution.
  /// The corresponding blocks for tx and each receipt may be not finalized yet
  #[default]
  ExecutedOptimistic,
  /// Transaction is included into finalized block
  IncludedFinal,
  /// Transaction is included into finalized block +
  /// All non-refund transaction receipts finished their execution.
  /// The corresponding blocks for each receipt may be not finalized yet
  Executed,
  /// Transaction is included into finalized block +
  /// Execution of all transaction receipts is finalized, including refund receipts
  Final,
}
```
