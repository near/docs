When API request fails, RPC server returns a structured error response with a
limited number of well-defined error variants, so client code can exhaustively
handle all the possible error cases. Our JSON-RPC errors follow
[verror](https://github.com/joyent/node-verror) convention for structuring
the error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "name": <ERROR_TYPE>,
    "cause": {
      "info": {..},
      "name": <ERROR_CAUSE>
    },
    "code": -32000,
    "data": String,
    "message": "Server error"
  },
  "id": "dontcare",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

> **Heads up**
>
> The fields `code`, `data`, and `message` in the structure above are considered
> legacy ones and might be deprecated in the future. Please, don't rely on them.
