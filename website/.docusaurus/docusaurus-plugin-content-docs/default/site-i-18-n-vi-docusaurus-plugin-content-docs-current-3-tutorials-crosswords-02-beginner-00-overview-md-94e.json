  "description": "In the last chapter we installed Rust and got up and running with a simple smart contract. The contract has a few issues, however, and isn't as powerful as we'd like it to be. For instance, we can only store one crossword puzzle in the smart contract, the frontend is  hardcoded, and we don't offer any incentives to the person who wins.",
